My primary goal is to do something good for the world in my lifetime, and some of these organizations do really incredible work.

I'm studying to become what can be translated from french as ""superior technician, specialized in managing and protecting of environment"". This is equivalent to 3 years after the baccalaur√©at (if that makes sense). It's a professionalising degree, but you can also, like most people, do a 3rd year of professional bachelor.

The french Government offers ""service civiques"" which is supposed to be a kind of internship, but in this case it's paid. 

There are 10-15 offers for these kind of internship as a naturalist (botany, ornithology, mammalogy,etc) on the Kerguelen islands and surrounding Antarctic islands every year. 

I read that among scientists, the seats for the boat are very expensive because there is a lot of demand but very few jobs.

My question is : do you think it will be VERY difficult to compete with others on these jobs ? When you do the balance between incredible opportunity both for a CV and life experiences, and the fact Antarctic islands aren't really the dream vacation place for most people, and the missions are a year long with no possibility of going home, what comes out for you ?

If America or Britain also have such islands and internship for lower degrees, have you heard of the competitivity of job offers there ?

I know I won't get much awnser most likely but I keep thinking about this and how much of a huge experience that would be in my life, but I can't stop to think that most likely I will have to compete with higher degrees (that have less field experience and work experience), and people who just are better than me.

Abstract: Ecological forecasting has vast potential to support environmental decision making with repeated, testable predictions across management-relevant timescales and locations. Yet resource managers rarely use co-designed forecasting systems or embed them in decision making. Although prediction of planned management outcomes is particularly important for biological invasions to optimize when and where resources should be allocated, spatial‚Äìtemporal models of spread typically have not been openly shared, iteratively updated, or interactive to facilitate exploration of management actions. We describe a species-agnostic, open-source framework ‚Äì called the Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) Forecasting Platform ‚Äì for co-designing near-term iterative forecasts of biological invasions. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate that iterative calibration yields higher forecast skill than using only the earliest-available data to predict future spread. The PoPS framework is a primary example of an ecological forecasting system that has been both scientifically improved and optimized for real-world decision making through sustained participation and use by management stakeholders.",1630909549

32,ecology,Is the Sahara desert actually vital for the survival of the Amazon Rainforest?,"[As NASA has stated,](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-satellite-reveals-how-much-saharan-dust-feeds-amazon-s-plants) the Sahara desert is purported to be a vital contributor of nutrients and materials for the Amazon Rainforest; with the help of wind, particles in the sands and the dust of the Sahara help water droplets form and create humidity.

My biggest question forms from the fact that the Sahara desert [ceases to become as such every ice age](https://news.mit.edu/2019/study-regulating-north-african-climate-0102).  With higher soil retention from the formation of grasslands, wouldn't a much smaller amount of dust be carried over to the Amazon Rainforest?  

And, if we follow the Amazon Rainforest's history back to post-Pangaea (but pre-Sahara), wouldn't that mean that the Amazon Rainforest existed in a time where the Sahara *didn't* supplement it with additional rainforests?

With those two questions in mind, is the Sahara actually vital for the survival of the Amazon rainforest?",1630898979

35,ecology,Predator Ecology?,"Does anyone know if there is a field of ecology I can study that focuses on predators? 

I want to go to graduate school and essentially study shark ecology, but I am extremely curious and interested in how predators (not just sharks) can shape and structure the entire ecosystem around them.

Here are some incomplete thoughts I have that I cannot quite put into a structured q

* How predatory species shape the community structure, richness, diversity, and essentially what is present within the community.
* How does the ecosystem at all trophic levels respond to the presence of the predator?
* One of the things I would like to know is how does something like a coral polyp or the pH of the water ultimately responds to the predator's presence via the many responses throughout the environment and community.
* Is there a field of ecology like ""Predatorial-Ecology"" (that is what I have termed it in my own head at least)

I feel like it would be a combination of many fields of ecology (behavioral+community+ecosystem+marine+functional+evolutionary)

This question must appear a mess, but in conclusion, I want to study predators and find out how they, directly and indirectly, affect EVERYTHING in their marine/aquatic environment.

One of the examples is of frigatebirds in Nauru and the connection that ancestral traditions have to reef ecology and therefore, the health and survival of communities. What I didn't talk about in the blog was how this relates to evolutionary biology. Many of the behavioural traits that animals exhibit in the short-term, don't accord with longer-term evolutionary gain. It's one of those paradoxes in ecology. For example, in the Prisoners' Dilemma Game Theory experiment, humans almost always lose. It's only when the experiment is repeated millions of times, that the result wins out. I think this concept applies to ecosystems too. The impact of animals or the relationship between wildlife and ecosystem function is often so small, that the only measurable components are often the more destructive aspects of behaviour. Because of this, ecologists risk continuously recording and observing behaviours that are detrimental. The beneficial traits are often the ones that exhibit the least measurable surplus. The classic example is the fact that the most nutrient-poor environments are the most species rich and have the greatest biomass. It's certainly an aspect of the science that I find fascinating to consider.

Abstract: Germination is considered as one of the most crucial steps in a plant‚Äôs lifetime. The germination of Eryngium maritimum, a dune species located across all European coasts, has been extensively analysed in Northern populations, where it is considered a locally endangered species. However, less attention has been given to southern populations, where the knowledge about the germination of the species is very limited. The main objective of the present study was to analyse the effect of cold stratification in one Mediterranean and one Atlantic population of the species, as well as to compare the potential variation of seed dormancy among a latitudinal gradient in European populations based on current literature. Seeds collected from Mallorca (Mediterranean, Spain) and Asturias (Atlantic, Spain) were germinated at different temperatures and cold stratification periods ranging from 4 to 20 weeks. These results were merged with the results of previous studies to test the potential effect of latitude and climatic variables in germination. Although the optimal incubation temperature was 10 ¬∫C, the highest final germination percentages (up to 96%) was obtained in both populations combining specific cold stratification periods (5 ¬∫C) and constant incubation temperatures (15‚Äì20 ¬∫C). Atlantic seeds needed longer cold stratification times to reach high germination percentages compared with Mediterranean seeds. Apart from the stratification response, significant differences in viability and in germination were observed between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean populations. Considering data from previous studies in the analysis, the results suggest that there is a potential effect of latitude in the ecological germination requirements, by which the higher the latitude, the longer the cold stratification period required to germinate, with a correlation with the mean annual temperature. These results suggests that two factors, modulation of dormancy relating to adaptative or maternal effects and viability, govern the germination of the species.",1630292487

91,ecology,Use and standardization of Presence/Absence &amp; Presence-only data,"Hello!

I have quite a niche bunch of questions about the use and standardization of **Presence/Absence** (P/A) &amp; **Presence-only** (P-O) **data** for a project that i working on. Not sure if this is the most appropriate place to post this, but i¬¥ll give it a shot!

I doing a litteraturer review of studies that has sample fish around a perticular kind of reef, and compiling their findings into a datasheet with presence information for each species. \*See table\* for example. 

The crux is that not all of these studies have complete records of Presence/Absence data available, only mentions of specific instances when a fish has been found (aka presence only information). So i end up with a datasheet with a **MIX** of data types; some columns containing Precense/Absence data, and others Precense-only data.

Important side note is that i¬¥m not looking at the explicit geographical locations of these observations (which rules out using methods for spatial modeling to combine the data types, as i understand can otherwise be an option.) I am only interested in the **relative frequency of presence** of a fish within separate location **classes** based on proximity to reefs (e.g. ""very close"", ""close "", ""far away"").

So, **my first questions are**: Is mixing these two data-types appropriate? If not, is there a way for me to ""treat"" my data so that a fusion of the two data -types would be possible? Or should i go with the easier options of either convert my P/A data into P-O data, or simply treat them separately?

**Secondly :** Not all studies i¬¥m looking at has data from all the distance classes i¬¥m interested in (regardless of whether or not it is P/A data, P-O data. See ""study B"" and ""C"" respectively in \*table below\*). How best would i calculate the relative frequency of fish presence so that it¬¥s comparable between location classes? Would the following equation work? 

""Nr. of Presence records \* (Tot. Nr. of studies in datasheet / Nr. studies with data)"" 

I apologize for the long post and hope it¬¥s not inappropriate. Thanks in advance!

All the best!

I'd totally be down for letting it grow and see what happens, if not for the fact that it'll take away almost all sun in the winter. The woods that grow there are natural and the lands are grazed for short periods each year. We could also put the wood to good use in the biomass heating we have. Currently, the wood isn't very high-grade (it's at least 50% hyper-fast growing alder or hazel). My parents just want to clear-cut everything, but I'm not too keen on that idea. The main reason is the fact that it grows on a patch of wetland. Removing the trees will probably make the lands much wetter still and possibly ruin the land more. 

I don't really know where to start since I'm pretty much a complete noob in ecology, so any resource that's of interest is welcome.

I've been a life-long fan of plants, nature and what not, and just recently decided to dive a bit deeper into botany.

This question came up when I was reading something - it said that turn over time of leaves correlates negatively with available nutritients in the soil, and I'd like to know the logic behind that.

If more nutrients -&gt; faster leaf drop&amp;regrow rate, then my amateurish attempt of explaining that would maybe be to say that in general, dropping old leaves and building new ones is beneficial (e.g. a plant grows, thus becomes able to uptake more nutritients and energy, thus being able to grow bigger leaves or leaves in a higher position with more sunlight, thus again getting more sunlight -&gt; energy, and so on - a positive cycle, so to speak).

And because it is beneficial in this way, if a plant can afford to drop old and build new leaves often, it does so.

Is that correct? Or absolute nonsense? If the latter, what is the reasoning behind that principle?",1629975610

I understand this time period varies from 12-72 hours depending on the water system in question, and longer times relate to places that have sewage runoff sites, lots of urban streets and grime, and other city-based things.  


Can someone inform me of a rough estimate of this rule's application to a small, rural lake that is both spring-fed and seated at relative elevation in comparison to the surrounding land?   


I imagine the effect would be minimal, given the the low level of human infrastructure development in the area, the lack of any large streams feeding into the lake, as well as the small surrounding area that would drain into the lake, given that it is seated at elevation.

Abstract: While there is increasing acceptance that non-neural organisms such as plants, slime moulds, and bacteria can perform behaviours, the vast kingdom of fungi is usually forgotten.

We argue that fungi can also be studied through the theoretical framework of behavioural ecology. This would benefit both fungal biologists ‚Äì yielding a better understanding of the lives of fungi ‚Äì and behavioural ecologists, providing access to model organisms that can help to explain the evolution of primary senses and potentially discover behaviours new to science.

Fungi have senses analogous to those of other organisms, they exhibit behaviour, and they have memory. This suggests a multitude of questions and new paths that could be taken to broaden our understanding of this forgotten and underestimated branch in the tree of life.",1629685336
21,ecology,The Stoat,"A little while ago I spotted a Stoat hunting in the wall at the bottom of our garden here in Northern England, they are very fascinating creatures to watch and there‚Äôs a lot more to them than meets the eye, so this inspired me to write a post about them, I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoy watching them!

**The Stoat**

The Stoat, *Mustela erminea*, is a Mustelid[,](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnmt3yh31rqa4qq/IMG_4542.jpg?dl=0) related to the Weasel and Otter, the first part of its scientific name; *Mustela*, relates to the species musty smell, and the second part; *erminea*, is the name given to a Stoat when it is wearing its [winter coat ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRdUyUTcbDI) . 

**Handsome predator**

In winter the Stoat‚Äôs fur changes colour from a rich [chestnut brown](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoBImages/comments/p8wl6p/curious_stoat/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) to the [purest white](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoBImages/comments/p8wq66/stoat_in_winter_coat_ermine/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), with the exception of the tip of its tail, which always remains black. Already a handsome animal it then becomes very beautiful with its shining black eyes and svelt white body. 

Ermine has for a long time been the preferred fur for [royalty](https://images.app.goo.gl/74qQU5FjcbQkuCeL7), worn for portraits and court presentations, as the white winter fur of the stoat is a purer white than any other fur, so signifying the purity of royalty. 

The seasonal change to white is to camouflage the animal in the ice and snow as it [hunts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q1dIEkTBx4). The Stoat being a small creature it needs to eat constantly and can‚Äôt build up the fat reserves larger animals can to hibernate over the winter, Mustelids as a species have a very high metabolism and the Stoat is particularly hyperactive. 

They prey on a wide variety of creatures; Voles, Mice and Shrews that they hunt for in burrows [and walls](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/ozu7s1/hello/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), [Beetles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/nrlriu/the_green_tiger_beetle/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and insects they will crunch up, young Hares, called leverets, that they find laying up hidden in the grass, Rabbits, adult and young birds and eggs too, which they have a particular liking for. They can bring down animals [much larger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNbqvqf3-14&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;list=LLOIU1f5XdTkXPHsGFOvQxpg) than themselves as well, being very persistent and tenacious predators. 

**Sanguinivorous bloodsuckers**

It used to be thought that the Stoat was ‚Äòsanguinivorous‚Äô; drinking blood, a belief probably brought about by their habit of bringing down large prey like adult rabbits by gripping them by their throat until they succumb to panic and exhaustion. They prefer younger rabbits though, cornering them in their burrows or even performing a sort of [dance](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ODEUK5sB5vE) to transfix them. 

I‚Äôve witnessed one of the Stoats famous dervishes, or dances, and they are quite hypnotic to watch, they will twist and wriggle their enormously flexible bodies about in front of the young rabbits, seemingly having some sort of fit, until they get close enough, and by this stage the rabbits for some reason are unable to move, and the stoat will suddenly jump at the rabbit which doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to defend itself at all, it‚Äôs very strange to see. 

The [track](https://images.app.goo.gl/DNyZ1ZQG6n4uTBwA7) of the stoat is very like that of a young rabbit and may be easily mistaken for it, they travel over an amazing extent of ground in their nocturnal rambles, as their marks in the [snow](https://images.app.goo.gl/Ngx8AfpCATJ2KBt2A) can testify, the edges of rivers and brooks being their favourite hunting grounds.

**Sworn enemy of the gamekeeper**

One of the favourite things a Stoat likes to eat, much to the gamekeepers and poultry farmers annoyance, are birds eggs. In spring, when ducks and wildfowl are nesting on the waters edge, they can lose their whole clutch to one marauding Stoat. Pheasants, [Grouse](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/owepdt/red_grouse_cock_on_waddington_fell_this_morning/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) and other gamebirds can lose their nests too, shoots that rely upon wild Pheasants will have a trap line around the boundaries to keep Stoat numbers from getting too high, and on the edges of a grouse moors keepers will maintain [traps](https://images.app.goo.gl/wWWXkJNVugTfbBTb6) too, although the traps you might see on planks of wood crossing streams on a Grouse moor will be for [Mink](https://images.app.goo.gl/GNFD8vbFMAMxRAgB8), as Stoats will not venture out into the open, preferring cover and tunnels. 

As real ermine is no longer fashionable amongst royalty, so there‚Äôs no value in its fur, and the Stoat is admired more than reviled nowadays, trapping is becoming an outdated pest control method, also traps are at risk of being destroyed by well intentioned ramblers and walkers with out any knowledge of the [gamekeeper‚Äôs work ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dml4f7_q7cU). So keepers, always resourceful, have had to move with the times and find proactive ways of looking after their birds. 

Habitat management, accepting the Stoats role as an important pest controller in its own right, has been found to be a lot more productive, Stoats are predated on by larger birds of prey too so keepers are quickly coming around to the idea that the presence of birds of prey such as the [Hen Harrier](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/o7sljh/hen_harrier_hunting_over_the_bowland_fells/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), on a shoot isn‚Äôt necessarily a problem, and that it may in fact be better to encourage them.

Studies have also been carried out into increases and decreases in Stoat populations and found there to be a correlation with increases in Voles and [Mice](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoBImages/comments/p8y24s/stoat_and_mouse_capture_rates/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), Stoats rearing more young in ‚Äòvole years‚Äô, [which occur in a 5 year cycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoBImages/comments/p8z3dq/vole_numbers_peak_every_5_years/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf), where food is abundant, but then that generation of Stoats finding Voles to be scarce the subsequent years, so having to diversify into other prey, such as a keepers birds! Now that this phenomenon is better understood, keepers can prepare for it rather than having to find the time to manage a line of dozens of fenn traps, which is a very time consuming job.

All this means that you are more likely than ever to spot a Stout, like the one you can see on the Yorkshire [tea box](https://images.app.goo.gl/FLViKUy3UBvsWxYy5) , out and about hunting the hedgerows and countryside nowadays, especially in winter before it‚Äôs snowed, when their white coat makes them stick out to owl, harrier and human alike. 

**A few tips for spotting Stoats**;

They *hate* the smell of tobacco smoke

They hate dogs

They are shortsighted so might not see you if you are still

You can tell where one is from the [alarm calls ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNQcBxUDHC4) of birds

I've been doing a bit of Googling, but not come across too much that addresses this specific concern. Any thoughts?

33,ecology,Feeling Indecisive: Grad School / Work Prospects,"Hello my green friends:  

Sooo I've always really loved nature, I'm the guy that will talk about animals, their habitats, and the issues threatening them.  Since graduating college in 2018 with a BS in environmental science, all I've had is unpaid volunteer work, or paid internships.  This year I decided to apply for a graduate program in Ecology because I've been living at home with my family and I need something in order to advance.  I'm 26 years old.    

I got into a program, but it's in another country (belgium).  I'm from the US.  It's affordable, (no I will not be receiving funding, my fault for not applying to funded programs) but I'm suddenly having cold feet.  I almost feel like saying no and applying to more programs this application cycle.    

I'm just so indecisive though:  I LOVE nature, ecology, etc, but I feel like I lack some of the strength needed for this lifestyle.  What do I mean?  Well...: 

\- The amount of seasonal work I'll need to do even WITH a masters in order to be competitive for a permanent position.

\- Not being able to stay in one place for too long due to the nature of seasonal work and needing to pursue it aggressively.

\- The fact that this university isn't very well ranked meaning I won't be able to make connections.

\- Being queer and not always being able to live in a big city.  

I promise these are all things that I've been thinking about well before now, but it takes a while for me to process stuff.  I'm mainly just very anxious about what the future holds, I'm afraid I'll just be in the same position I'm in now two years later.  Have any of you had similar experiences?

Abstract: Ecosystem engineers have large impacts on the communities in which they live, and these impacts may feed back to populations of engineers themselves. In this study, we assessed the effect of ecosystem engineering on density-dependent feedbacks for midges in Lake M√Ωvatn, Iceland. The midge larvae reside in the sediment and build silk tubes that provide a substrate for algal growth, thereby elevating benthic primary production. Benthic algae are in turn the primary food source for the midge larvae, setting the stage for the effects of engineering to feed back to the midges themselves. Using a field mesocosm experiment manipulating larval midge densities, we found a generally positive but nonlinear relationship between density and benthic production. Furthermore, adult emergence increased with the primary production per midge larva. By combining these two relationships in a simple model, we found that the positive effect of midges on benthic production weakened negative density-dependence at low to intermediate larval densities. However, this benefit disappeared at high densities when midge consumption of primary producers exceeded their positive effects on primary production through ecosystem engineering. Our results illustrate how ecosystem engineering can alter density-dependent feedbacks for engineer populations.",1629087068

61,ecology,"To what extent do you think the individual is responsible for climate change, and solving it ?","Yeah I know this question must have been asked a million times already. And I also hate the word ""climate change"" because it's so vague and meaningless, but had to keep the title somewhat short.

I believe a big reason why nothing is really done to inhibit climate change is that *everyone* is blaming everyone : Europeans are blaming USA and China, Americans are blaming China. Consumers are blaming big businesses, Big businesses are blaming consumers etc etc.

I am sure there isnt a clear response of ""who is at fault"" because everyone is at fault to some extent. The question would rather be ""who is the most at fault in causing and perpetrating climate change?""

Imo Big businesses would be at fault, because they have no moral values unless it brings them money. What is the point of saving the planet if it doesn't bring money. I'm not trying to say corpos are pure evil it's just a cold and pragmatic analysis. In a capitalist world the goal of a business is to grow and earn as much as possible. With that mentality, big businesses can *never* reduce climate change because it isn't profitable as of today. 

However it could be profitable if there was a demand for more ecological products. This is where the role of the consumer takes place : should the consumer create a demand for ecological products, or should businesses force that demand, following ethical principles. Well if you have the mentality of most big businesses today, and it's understandable given the economy we live in, it's the consumers role to create that demand and to have more ecological behaviours. 

From my perspective, which might be biased since I live in a young environment of a generation who got soon educated to ecology, most people take climate change seriously and *want* to buy ecological products but are held back by two things : the high cost of organic food and products, and the low choice of options. And, well, when there is only few of a product produced and the cost is high, that usually means there is low demand. But the fact is there isn't. So this is a weird paradox that I believe is perpetrated by big businesses, because ecological products cost more to produce and are less profitable, so they create some ""green"" products in order to say ""hey buy our products we are so sustainable"" but nobody really buys them because they cost so much. Or even they just slap some green on the usual product : see the detergent aisle which is now full green colored. It would be much easier the other way around : if big businesses forced demand by progressively creating more and more really ecological products (no green washing bs) and stopping production of harmfull products. This would make people buy more of these products because with high production, production cost would fall and it would become more available for people to buy so it would eventually balance out. 

There is another problem tho, that I believe is more of the consumers fault : well... Consumerism. We have become so accustomed to getting everything from everywhere delivered withing a week, throwing away broken items not even thinking about repair. Also we think that food should be as cheap as possible and we are not willing to sacrifice a bigger part of our salary in food, in order to buy higher quality food or more sustainable food. I read somewhere that where I live food cost used to be like more than a third of a households budget. For a person preparing food at home, living alone, and gaining minimal wage it is more like 1/10th now. A huge part of the problem would be solved by solving consumerism.

When it comes to states responsabilit√©s : a working democracy *should* represent the will of the people from a country. As I said I feel like people really would like to inhibit climate change. The problem is most western governments are heavily being lobbied by corporates which have no incentive to act on climate change, thus stopping or slowing any government decisions to happen. However even if governments do act on climate change it automatically affects people's buying power and they get *very* mad, so this is also slowing things down, because everyone wants to save the world but nobody wants to give a bit of what's theirs.

Hope this post finds you well. I'm currently in my mid-30s and looking to retrain. I've always been interested in science and have sort of promised myself that I would study a science at some point in my life. I've been looking at different science areas and am considering medical lab science, food science, or ecology. I was just wondering if anyone had any info about the job prospects for ecology in Australia?

I use another forum called 'whirlpool' and according to them there are basically no jobs in ecology in NSW Australia, that it's super competitive and not worth even trying. Just wanted to know if that is true or not. 

I live on the Central Coast of NSW and would not be willing to move for a job (I have a family and I feel that moving is a younger man's game) but would be filling to commute to Sydney and Newcastle. I'm not trying to be entitled. I understand that if I'm unwilling to move that means that I should adjust my expectations. Just want to do some research to find out what the best science option is for me.

So what do you think? Is it worth studying ecology or should scratch it off the list of potentials?

Abstract: Invasive species threaten biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human health, but the long-term drivers of invasion dynamics remain poorly understood. We use data from a 28-year ongoing survey of a Northern California ant community invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) to investigate the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on invasion dynamics. We found that the distribution of L. humile retracted following an extreme drought that occurred in the region from 2012 ‚Äì 2015. The distribution of several native ant species also contracted, but overall native ant diversity was higher after the drought and for some native ant species, distributions expanded over the 28-year survey period. Using structural equation models, we found the strongest impact on the distribution of L. humile was from direct effects of climate, namely cumulative precipitation and summer maximum temperatures, with only a negligible role for biotic resistance and indirect effects of climate mediated by native ants. The increasing drought and high temperature extremes projected for northern California due to anthropogenic driven climate change may limit the spread, and possibly the impact, of L. humile in invaded regions. The outcome will depend on the response of native ant communities to these climatic stressors.",1628473284

I'm a digital media artist now studying MA at Royal College of Art, and currently, I'm doing researches for an independent project. The theme of my project is related to ecology/light-pollution/moth/subjectivities. The aim of this project is to use media techniques to create an immersive environment to bring awareness, inspire the audience to pay attention to environmental problems.

But I'm not specialized in ecology or environment science, so I really hope if someone could help me research and design a prototype. It is best to cooperate until the end of the project. This project would be displayed on February 2022 at RCA final digital show and I'll put your name on it!

By the way, this is my first independent project, so I'm also exploring. However, if anyone who is professional in ecology/light pollution, as well as interested in or want to try doing artworks, you can join in with me and release your creativity! 

Thanks for reading :)

16,ecology,Effortpost on fire ecology and the failure of fire suppression,"This is a pet issue for me, my primary political concerns are ecological, and I live in the southwest,  but as mike davis pointed out in [The Case for Letting  Malibu Burn](https://longreads.com/2018/12/04/the-case-for-letting-malibu-burn/), the class aspects are not totally separable from the ecology.  I'm mostly not going to focus on the Mike Davis essay and the class analysis, bc trueanon already did that, and I think that some of the details about the science and wonk stuff from a different piece are worth shining a light on.  But mike Davis' essay is great for tracing some of the bizarre history, geography, and ecology of fire suppression.  It addresses how extremely wealthy homeowners in Malibu have basically gotten protected by the government and in some cases private fire fighting contractors.  the most bizarre part to me was how many homeowners in Malibu actually preemptively spray their shrubs with the commercially used fire retardant foam (the red stuff that big fire fighting helicopter crews drop on huge wildfires).  Maybe that's only surreal to me bc I'm not an angeleno.  But it's just weird how casual that is. 
However, while I recommend reading that essay, and listening to the Mike Davis Trueanon appearance, I wanted to address this in a way that focuses even more on the science, particularly bc everyone maybe already is familiar with the mike davis polemic amd the class issues involved.  

I'd like to argue that we should start making the term ""the war on fire"" synonymous with other quixotic and now-infamous government quests like the war on drugs and the war on terror.   Firefighters seem more above criticism in the public eye than figures like cops, and less divisive.  A lot of that is for good reason and they're certainly less bad on personal moral level than cops, yet there is a difference e between urban firefighters who are immediately saving lives and wildland firefighters who literally most of the time statistically are fighting fires that most likely won't kill anyone, and the suppression of them will kill more people than save , due to how inevitable fire is in most western ecologies even if you pour tons of money into it and dump tons of crap on it. 

I was also surprised to learn how much money firefighters for CalFire make ( ""The median compensation package ‚Äî including base pay, special pay, overtime and benefits ‚Äî for full time Cal Fire firefighters of all categories is more than $148,000 a year.‚Äù--ProPublica) and appalled if less surprised to learn how big the calfire budget is compared to budgets for things like controlled burning or basically anything preventative.  
(When you see the numbers , you might understand that as drastic as the case of getting all of the people evacuated permanently from the worst fire zones sounds, paying them to do it might be more feasible than what we will spend on waging an eternal war against fire itself.  Or even stuff like subsidizing hepa filters and masks for everyone in the vicinity of controlled burns --one of the only possible legitimate oppositions to controlled burns is the smoke they cause that can be a legitimate problem for people with health issues ... Although *of course* this objection doesnt take into account that fire and the resulting smoke are inevitable,  and smoke every summer was noted as an occurrence in pre gold rush/developed California).  So yeah, while this cant be a completed effortpost due to my Ltd energy and time I'll continue with a few more points and choice quotes from one of the best articles I've read on this.   Starting from the stuff about how fucked up the economic incentives and bloat of Calfire is. 
 [Note: I'm focusing the most heavily on calfire for a few reasons: One--california is a big state, with a uniquely intense fire ecology, often causing worse fires than southwestern states that have just as hot and dry summers, due to Santa ana winds and chaparral in coastal ranges and stuff, and the california fires not only effect more people than other states due to how big california is population wise, but the smoke effects people everywhere in the US.  Two, I believe calfire is sort of the apotheosis of everything wrong with fire suppression,  and even if it's a bit more extreme in its mistakes than other local fire agencies, it represents the same problems , just taken to another level.  Three, California politicians, even if California has it's own fire agency, most likely greatly affect federal agencies as well and the way fire is approached nationally.  I was horrified recently to learn that [Gavin Newsom is personally calling for the slight recent improvements in fire policy to be rolled back](https://www.oregonlive.com/wildfires/2021/08/forest-service-changes-let-it-burn-wildfire-policy-after-criticism-from-politicians.html?outputType=amp&amp;__twitter_impression=true).  The title of the article is misleading, the policy basically only applied to letting wildfires in very remote forest burn and even then, I'm pretty sure they preventatively corralled the fires with fire breaks and even fire retardant usage here and there.  In the article it says that federal officials are listening and planning on adjusting the policy to cater to Newsom.  So I guess how fire is approached by Californians may end up being how fire is approached by the whole country.  It's also worth noting that while conservatives probably have worse approaches to general environmental problems and conservation, this fire ecology issue is a devastating fuckup in one of the most left-leaning states... and yes I know liberals aren't leftists, but california voters are on paper more open to leftism, if you take their primary votes etc as indication... so if california cant make dealing with the most simple current ecological issue politically palatable,  who can?  The southeast, with conservative governors, is largely better at controlled burns, although if you were trying to excuse california you.could say it's the risk of fire going out of control being hire in california.  Source: [this wonderfully thorough and bleak propublica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/they-know-how-to-prevent-megafires-why-wont-anybody-listen). ]
""More quantitatively ‚Äî and related ‚Äî fire suppression in California is big business, with impressive year-over-year growth. Before 1999, Cal Fire never spent more than $100 million a year. In 2007-08, it spent $524 million. In 2017-18, $773 million. Could this be Cal Fire‚Äôs first $1 billion season? Too early to tell, but don‚Äôt count it out. On top of all the state money, federal disaster funds flow down from ‚Äúthe big bank in the sky,‚Äù said Ingalsbee. Studies have shown that over a quarter of U.S. Forest Service fire suppression spending goes to aviation ‚Äî planes and helicopters used to put out fire. A lot of the ‚Äúair show,‚Äù as he calls it, happens not on small fires in the morning, when retardant drops from planes are most effective, but on large fires in the afternoon. But nevermind. You can now call in a 747 to drop 19,200 gallons of retardant. Or a purpose-designed Lockheed Martin FireHerc, a cousin of the C-130. How cool is that? Still only 30% of retardant is dropped within 2,000 yards of a neighborhood, meaning that it stands little chance of saving a life or home. Instead the airdrop serves, at great expense, to save trees in the wilderness, where burning, not suppression, might well do more good.

This whole system is exacerbated by the fact that it‚Äôs not just contracts for privately owned aircraft. Much of the fire-suppression apparatus ‚Äî the crews themselves, the infrastructure that supports them ‚Äî is contracted out to private firms. ‚ÄúThe Halliburton model from the Middle East is kind of in effect for all the infrastructure that comes into fire camps,‚Äù Beasley said, referencing the Iraq war. ‚ÄúThe catering, the trucks that you can sleep in that are air-conditioned‚Ä¶‚Äù
So yeah, the funding is growing a ton, and is already pretty large.  The funding for doing controlled burns is way smaller, and they're surprisingly hard to get done: ""By comparison, planning a prescribed burn is cumbersome. A wildfire is categorized as an emergency, meaning firefighters pull down hazard pay and can drive a bulldozer into a protected wilderness area where regulations typically prohibit mountain bikes. Planned burns are human-made events and as such need to follow all environmental compliance rules. That includes the Clean Air Act, which limits the emission of PM 2.5, or fine particulate matter, from human-caused events. In California, those rules are enforced by CARB, the state‚Äôs mighty air resources board, and its local affiliates. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve talked to many prescribed fire managers, particularly in the Sierra Nevada over the years, who‚Äôve told me, ‚ÄòYeah, we‚Äôve spent thousands and thousands of dollars to get all geared up to do a prescribed burn,‚Äô and then they get shut down.‚Äù Maybe there‚Äôs too much smog that day from agricultural emissions in the Central Valley, or even too many locals complain that they don‚Äôt like smoke. Reforms after the epic 2017 and 2018 fire seasons led to some loosening of the CARB/prescribed fire rules, but we still have a long way to go.

‚ÄúOne thing to keep in mind is that air-quality impacts from prescribed burning are minuscule compared to what you‚Äôre experiencing right now,‚Äù said Matthew Hurteau, associate professor of biology at University of New Mexico and director of the Earth Systems Ecology Lab, which looks at how climate change will impact forest systems. With prescribed burns, people can plan ahead: get out of town, install a HEPA filter in their house, make a rational plan to live with smoke. Historical accounts of California summers describe months of smoky skies, but as a feature of the landscape, not a bug."" [ProPublica].


I realize at this point I'm mostly quoting pieces from this aforementioned article, although tbf you should still read the article bc it is more detailed.  And the article is detailed in terms of documenting every point it makes, but crystal clear in terms of the central thesis:  A) The science is settled in terms of controlled burns and more laissez faire approach to existing natural wildfires being the right thing for preventing awful megafires,  and other negative ecological consequences (some trees actually thrive better in fire... one example from the other coast is the New Jersey pine barrens , which would be outcompeted by other species if fire was totally or mostly stopped there). B) nobody is listening to that science.  

But even if the article is fairly clear about that, maybe I can illustrate it in simpler terms and what stands out to a layperson like me:  I've always known, even since I was a kid, that controlled burns were ""good"", bc my dad told me about them, and they're considered as good things in the popular consciousness.  **But not only do we do far too little controlled burns, but controlled burns arent enough.  We need to let more wildfires burn. This is something that makes people the most uncomfortable.  After all, by their literal definitional nature, wildfires can be, well, wild, and difficult to control.  The upper middle class and wealthy, as documented in the Mike Davis essay, is concerned about property damage in a more abstract way, something that hurts their investment and excess or discretionary income, whereas other communities of poorer people may genuinely be coming from a place of worrying so much from precarity, that the extra volatility of allowing *more* natural disasters that threaten their shelter may seem counterintuitive and awful.**  as someone who lives on ssi, which is below the poverty line,  much of the time in the southwest, and reaches for my inhaler or mask even when the air quality index reaches yellow, I understand these fears.  They are not unreasonable.  But the choice has to be understood not in terms of fire or no fire , but more in terms of kicking the can down the road year after year, in a way that basically ensures volatility will increase , greatly.  Bc our fires would be bad just from the fuel stockpile backlog , without adding climate issues and increased exurban development into the mix.  

The humanist here might say ""well yeah it's easy to say all these things but millions of people already live in fire prone areas"", and the class conscious leftist may add ""and now poor or lower middle class communities are being added to the fire zones, even if it used to be the clear dichotomy between the wealthy in Malibu who get subsidies and protection from the inevitable first and the poor in the inner city who get inadequate protection from the fires that aren't actually inevitable.  Additionally, its hard for poor people to just move"".  And the race conscious leftist may add that the racial wealth gap being what it is and the environmental racism being what it is, short term effects of any increasing burns will be hitting communities of color hardest.  

My response would be that even if you ignore that this is inevitable medium term, and focus entirely on the short term (like we have to put out this fire or those people will suffer, today), that with the bloated budgets from paying for an eternal war on fire, you could pay people to relocate, subsidize cities or towns in non fire zones , with jobs programs,  and give everyone a hepa air purifier and masks that cant leave.  We are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars for California alone.  
Heres a passage that talks about a training exercise envisioning both a) what would wake people up about the problem, and b) what we are going to choose between, since theres no option to just suppress fire out of existence:

"". In 2014, Goulette participated in a planning exercise known as the Quadrennial Fire Review, or QFR, that asked the grim question: What is the disaster scenario that finally causes us to alter in a meaningful way our relationship and response to fire? The answer: something along the lines of a megafire taking out San Diego. In the wake of it, Goulette and others imagined one scenario in which the U.S. Forest Service morphed into an even more militaristic firefighting agency that ‚Äúoverwhelmingly emphasizes full suppression‚Äù and is ‚Äúextremely risk averse.‚Äù But they also envisioned a scenario that spawned a new kind of fire force, one focused on ‚Äúmonitoring firesheds‚Äù and dedicated to changing the dominant philosophy away ‚Äúfrom the war on fire to living with fire.‚Äù [Propublica]

Again, if this is such an obvious scientific thing then why aren't we doing controlled burns all the time, already ?  The question may seem naive with how badly we've ignored the established science on climate science, but the climate science is harder to grasp for laypeople.  It's more non linear with more complex math and modeling, whereas in this case laypeople could actually read a bit and reason some and come to the conclusion that yeah, fires are good for forests.   So if it's that obvious,  why aren't we doing it?

""In the Southeast which burns more than twice as many acres as California each year ‚Äî fire is defined as a public good. Burn bosses in California can more easily be held liable than their peers in some other states if the wind comes up and their burn goes awry. At the same time, California burn bosses typically suffer no consequences for deciding not to light. No promotion will be missed, no red flags rise. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always extra political risk to a fire going bad,‚Äù Beasley said. ‚ÄúSo whenever anything comes up, people say, OK, that‚Äôs it. We‚Äôre gonna put all the fires out.‚Äù For over a month this spring, the U.S. Forest Service canceled all prescribed burns in California, and training for burn bosses, because of COVID-19.

I asked Beasley why he ignited his burns anyway when he was Yosemite fire chief. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm single! I‚Äôm not married! I have no kids. Probably a submarine captain is the best person for the job.‚Äù Then he stopped joking. ‚ÄúI was a risk taker to some degree. But I also was a believer in science.‚Äù"" [Propublica]

The US settlers took over an existing space where the natives were clearly managing fire well, with controlled burns and an understanding of the nature and impact of the fire seasons, that came from experience.  Maybe some of the first settlers simply had racism ingrained enough to discount native experience , but where did the idea to do large scale fire suppression, not just city firefighting,  even come from? 
""The overarching reason is culture. In 1905, the U.S. Forest Service was created with a military mindset. Not long after, renowned American philosopher William James wrote in his essay ‚ÄúThe Moral Equivalent of War‚Äù that Americans should redirect their combative impulses away from their fellow humans and onto ‚ÄúNature.‚Äù The war-on-fire mentality found especially fertile ground in California, a state that had emerged from the genocide and cultural destruction of tribes who understood fire and relied on its benefits to tend their land. That state then repopulated itself in the Gold Rush with extraction enthusiasts, and a little more than half a century later, it suffered a truly devastating fire. Three-thousand people died, and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and attendant fires. The overwhelming majority of the destruction came from the flames, not the quake. Small wonder California‚Äôs fire ethos has much more in common with a field surgeon wielding a bone saw than a preventive medicine specialist with a tray full of vaccines.""


It's also possible that theres some more esoteric ideological stuff going on here than just the profit motives and people wanting to save their homes.  The whole US, but especially the western frontier and particularly post gold rush California , have suffered from certain millenarian enthusiasms for creating a heaven on earth.  As noted by Mircea Eliade a) even secular man unconsciously keeps religious notions  and b) one of the most important religious notions is the idea of sacred and profane space: as cosmos versus chaos, one organized and one disorganized, and man having founded the cosmos by sometimes violently organizing that space.  This can take benign or malignant forms (it's an old impulse) and I believe the settler ideology and the sheer unreality of the suburban utopianism that leads people in Los Angeles area in particular,  but also other similar sprawled communities in hostile ecologies, to become totally taken over by the idea that they can create a strange suburban heaven on earth, an order in the midst of nature's chaos.  

Probably one of the best explorations of these tendencies is the essay [Los Angeles against the Mountains](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1988/09/26/los-angeles-against-the-mountains-i) by John McPhee, who is known for his writings on ecology.  This article is almost entirely about debris flows and landslides, but the exploration of this ideology that makes people consider that they could simple put their stucco mcmansions in zones prone to natural disasters, is very relevant to the approach to fire in this country.   If you cant get past the new Yorker paywall I'm sure you could find the article somewhere,  it's a famous essay.  Not quoting it for now bc this has become a long enough post. 

On a closing note I wanted to get back to some of the sobering numbers in the ProPublica piece.  

""Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California‚Äôs agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change. We live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres ‚Äî an area about the size of Maine ‚Äî to restabilize in terms of fire.""

To reiterate:  up to **11 million acres a year used to burn*, we are controlled burning the **tiniest fraction of that (20,000)** and have no plan to even get **close to a million**, which would be in the ballpark maybe but not a good enough ""vaccine"" against megafires now that the climate is worsening and the backlog gets longer.  

And additionally, we are not just fighting fire with water, and with trenches etc.  We are now using fire retardant foam called phoschek.  There is concern that this foam is a) ecologically harmful b) ineffective and c) *possibly* harmful to humans.  

It seems likely theres little direct toxicity to humans, but there is certainly documented damage to watersheds and the creatures that live in them, to the extent that its theoretically not supposed to be dropped on waterways.  One problem with that is that when it comes to high mountain fires, like in the sierras, we are not just dealing with rivers, all the snowmelt essentially trickles to feed one river or the other.  Theres also the question of secondary or tertiary effects.  Phos chek is pretty simple and one of the main ingredients is phosphate.  It could probably be eaten without that much harm, but phosphate and other nutrients have been found to feed harmful microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria,  in a process called eutrophication (literally meaning ""enrichment "", that is becoming a major issue for animal and human health in waterways from Florida's to the midatlantic's to the ponds of new england and the many lakes of the upper midwest. )  I don't see why phos chek would be an exception.  Its  [documented](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://celake.ucanr.edu/files/219267.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiB4OvPsp7yAhUCXM0KHbL_Ax4QFnoECAMQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw0z3FIYYB5P80B7s1Hx3SnL) to cause eutrophication when applied to waterways but I dont see how we'd make a neat distinction with how easy it is to keep out of waterways and possible secondary effects it could have with soil microbiome as well. 

This last part on the problem of health effects from fire retardant is all fairly speculative,  but again, its just icing on the cake of all of the extremely well documented negative effects and stupidity of fire suppression.  Those speculative links shouldn't be what you focus on the most. 

This should be the takeaway:   **all scientists im aware of in this area agree that controlled burns and laissez faire wildfire management is the way to go to get fires under control, but practically nobody in a position of power listens.  It may be political suicide , additionally, to be anti war on fire **

Knowing more about this has blackpilled me in most ways but maybe a single positive takeaway is that in theory this is an easier issue to solve than something like climate change.  And one in which local policy actually matters.

Reading this article got me thinking. The hypoxia doesn't come from the algae that grows as a result of agricultural runoff, it comes from the bacterial decomposition of the excess biomass.

I then thought about how algae is so great at Carbon sequestration.

Imagine if we were able to actually solve eutrophication, that would *dramatically* reduce global algae levels. Given that so much CO2 is absorbed by this algae, wouldn't that dramatically expedite climate change?

So here's my crazy idea.

How do we keep the algae but eliminate hypoxic zones?

What if we just aerated the water itself? Surely some passive force from wave motion or wind could provide oxygenation capabilities in these areas.

What would happen to the bacteria populations with this influx of oxygen? The decomposing biomass levels would stay the same, so it shouldn't really expand their numbers too much...right?

Because I want to do it with an Arduino and non-random, I would like to feed the system with a 365-day data set on precipitation, light intensity, and temperature curve.

I hope someone can help me, cheers!",1628007864

Abstract: 


Macrophyte species and trait assemblages from 104 minimally disturbed boreal forest lakes, covering broad environmental and geographic gradients were analysed to identify associations with environmental variables at different spatial scales: geographic context (GEO) and catchment (CATCH) and lake (LOCAL) characteristics.

Constrained ordination and variation partitioning were used to quantify variation in species (canonical correspondence analysis [CCA] and pCCA) and trait (redundancy analysis [RDA] and pRDA) compositions that could be explained by environmental variables, and to rank the main environmental factors associated with spatial and temporal patterns.

Diversity and assemblage composition correlated with spatial context and variables related to the length of the growing season, catchment forest type and with lake characteristics such as ecosystem size, lake productivity and alkalinity.

Variation partitioning showed that lake characteristics alone explained 53% (species) and 73.5% (traits) of the variability in macrophyte assemblages. Contrary to predictions, the shared variance component between latitude and catchment forest type (GEO&amp;CATCH &lt; 0.1% for both species and traits) and between latitude and lake characteristics (GEO&amp;LOCAL = 6.7% for species and 3.9% for traits) was low.

Temporal variability, measured as changes in species richness, diversity and a pollution-specific index (the Trophic Macrophyte Index), using a subset of the lakes sampled on two occasions (19 lakes sampled in 2012 and 2018 and five lakes sampled in 2013 and 2019) did not differ (p &gt; 0.05, paired t-test). Ordination showed that among-year variability in macrophyte assemblage composition was also negligible (0.3%) compared to the variability explained by GEO, CATCH and LOCAL variables. Combined, these findings indicate low species turnover in the boreal lakes of our study.

Responses of macrophyte species and trait assemblages and the TMI index were predictable and significantly correlated with lake characteristics associated with nutrient enrichment (Chl a, nutrients) and alkalinity supporting their use in monitoring eutrophication of boreal lakes.",1627871126
54,ecology,Are there countries or areas where ecologists are in-demand?,"I am working on my BS in ecology in BC, Canada. I'm not sure what I want to do with it yet but seem to be leaning towards consulting. As housing prices here have skyrocketed, I doubt I'll ever be able to have the life I want, especially as I know there's not a lot of money to be made in ecology. I keep my eye on the job market and the majority of the consulting jobs are in the city where it's very expensive to live. I know cost of living is high everywhere but I'm sure many places don't compare to Vancouver.

Once I'm done school, there's a good chance I'll need/want to relocate to somewhere else in Canada or even overseas. It seems though that immigration is difficult unless you have a high demand career. Are there places that want people in this field, countries you can move to with this career?

56,ecology,What are everyone‚Äôs thoughts on Rewilding?,"I‚Äôm currently studying Ecology and please pardon my ignorance, but is rewilding a helpful way to fight the loss of biodiversity and climate change?

Rewilding does seem to be helpful to increase dwindling populations of vulnerable species, and rewilding keystone species is important for the ecosystem because they will help restore balance to trophic cascades.   What I fail to understand is, isn‚Äôt releasing animals that have started dying out/died out of an ecosystem just put pressure back on the ecosystem in the long-term and cause the rewilded population to die out to what the ecosystem can carry?

It seems very short-term to me. In the case of rewilding gray wolves in the Rocky Mountains region, I see it is very important because it helps control the herbivore populations like deer and thus flora populations also.  So yes, the gray wolves would have a hell of a time with the large herbivore populations, but after sometime, as other threats to
Biodiversity come into play (habitat destruction, human encroachment, pollution, and over harvesting) they will once again be under threat and die out. 

It‚Äôs not that I am against rewilding.  It‚Äôs fantastic and it helps restore keystone species and balance to the ecosystem.  I‚Äôm just looking to understand why it wouldn‚Äôt be better to diverge what little resources Parks and Wildlife gets to more important threats like habitat destruction, invasive species, and others.",1627840990

* Bring greater awareness the impacts of our decisions and way of life,
* Encourage children to question how their dreams play a part in the ""bigger picture"" and what they think a happy, functional society looks like.

The activities / ideas suggested should be palatable for most parents, so that they can encourage their children's fascination.

62,ecology,Hear me out‚Ä¶ weird restoration ecology plan that I‚Äôve been pondering,"Let‚Äôs start with the basics of the ecosystem I‚Äôm thinking about. Kelp forests in the Pacific Northwest (Pacific Ocean off of the northwest coast of the US). They have become infested with invasive sea urchins that eat and kill massive amounts of kelp, destroying the foundation of the ecosystem. Sea otters prey on these urchins, meaning that their presence allows the kelp to flourish. Sea otters are often preyed on by killer whales, usually when there is no other available prey for the whales. Killers whales evolved to hunt OTHER WHALES which are in short supply these days, so they are often seen snacking on sea lions (atleast in nature documentaries).

My proposal is to establish a rookery of native sea lions on beaches in the vicinity of a suffering kelp forest. This would be done by finding an underutilized beach in the area and doing some slight alterations that would make it prime sea lion breeding grounds. The idea is that killer whales will prey on the sea lions, sea otters will deal with less pressure, sea otter populations could rise and they could do what they do best and work on the sea urchin population, restoring some kind of balance to the ecosystem. 

Does this sound like a feasible restoration, or are there too many other variables in the equation that could make the situation worse? I‚Äôd love to see what y‚Äôall think",1627763115

82,ecology,How do trees behave?,"I'm trying to build a tool that can scatter 3D vegetation assets based on a somewhat true-to-life simulation (albeit grossly simplified).   


So a question that arose is: How do trees behave? When do they die if they are in shade, what happens if they touch a neighboring tree.   


Or to be more precise: How would trees behave if they were cylinders agnostic of light direction. For now, I'm just using the canopy radius as a shaded area and don't take any sunlight calculations into account to keep this project somewhat realistic for me.  


After some testing around my best guess would be:   


""Grow in width and height until you meet a neighboring tree, then only continue to grow in height until you reach your maximum height.""  


A more complex model, but still doable, would be to take a ""distance from trunk"" and the canopy into account so that trees after a certain age can have saplings grow in their shade if their canopy is light-permeable.   


It's difficult to realize in 3D because the models are prefabricated and you don't want a tree to grow into the canopy from another from below. But from what I observed saplings grow of course often right under the canopy of another tree if it's a sparse one like birch or something similar.   


I'm sorry if that is all a bit diffuse, but maybe you, reading this here, know exactly what you would want to tell me in my situation; So I came here to ask.   


Ultimately, it is planned to have a complete succession system where different species interact with each other - ferns and saplings compete for the sparse light under the crowns, etc.

Abstract: Ambush predators such as spiders affect the flower-visiting behavior of diurnal pollinators such as bees (Dukas 2001, Dukas and Morse 2003), potentially causing diurnal pollinators to avoid flowers where ambush predators wait (Dukas 2001). Thus, ambush predators can diminish the reproductive success of flowering plants (Gon√ßalves-Souza et al. 2008). Although nocturnal insects such as moths are important pollinators of many flowering plants (Hahn and Br√ºhl 2016), the impact of ambush predators on nocturnal pollinators remains unclear.",1627267862

My question is this: what is a fairly minimal set of species to populate this ecosystem adequately for the long term? We don't have to assume that the aliens selected them optimally or that it would be self-sufficient without the humans living there. In fact, some suboptimal choices would be interesting. For example, it could be that most of the species are plants and the only non-human animals are rabbits. Without the humans, the rabbits would have no predators, multiply a lot, eat lots of vegetation; maybe this would still be sustainable, since the rabbit population would surely dwindle whenever the vegetation got too sparse and vice versa, but the humans definitely could prevent this cycle by controlling the rabbit population.

Currently, I've been writing a rough draft with at least the following species:

* oak or maple or both
* corn
* potato
* carrot
* flax
* rabbit
* some sort of bushy plant I haven't settled on yet

I'm not super attached to most of these except for maybe the flax. My characters have also already observed that there are no birds in the trees or worms in the soil. The list *feels* kind of naive to me right now, so I'm asking for help. I expect folks in this subreddit might think this is kind of fun anyway. :)",1627042347

14,ecology,Gymnosperms,"Gymnosperms as we all know are a very old lineage of plants. Their pollen is smaller on average compared to the pollen of most plants due to their need to reproduce via air as they haven't coevolved the need to attract beneficial pollinating bugs. This applies to my area of the world in particular, as in New Zealand we have many native conifers and a wide appreciation for ginkgoes and cycads too. Kauri are one of NZ's most widely known species and an interpretation of its cone is in the center of the image. The black smears also happen to represent their death. Kauri dieback has massacred populations of Kauri and caused widespread damage to ecosystems here. This is particularly bad because of our colonial ancestors who tore down over 80 percent of our native forests. A story repeated many times in our world.

Abstract: Ecosystem transformation involves the emergence of persistent ecological or social‚Äìecological systems that diverge, dramatically and irreversibly, from prior ecosystem structure and function. Such transformations are occurring at increasing rates across the planet in response to changes in climate, land use, and other factors. Consequently, a dynamic view of ecosystem processes that accommodates rapid, irreversible change will be critical for effectively conserving fish, wildlife, and other natural resources, and maintaining ecosystem services. However, managing ecosystems toward states with novel structure and function is an inherently unpredictable and difficult task. Managers navigating ecosystem transformation can benefit from considering broader objectives, beyond a traditional focus on resisting ecosystem change, by also considering whether accepting inevitable change or directing it along some desirable pathway is more feasible (that is, practical and appropriate) under some circumstances (the RAD framework). By explicitly acknowledging transformation and implementing an iterative RAD approach, natural resource managers can be deliberate and strategic in addressing profound ecosystem change.",1626661166

57,ecology,"Crazy idea: would a global atlas of conservation, restoration, and ecological reconciliation help us avert crisis?","The philosopher Wendell Berry said, we need to solve for pattern. To solve problems we have to be able to act on them systemically.

A general principle I think might be true is that: people want to help the extinction crisis but don‚Äôt know how, exactly, to do so. They also often do not understand fully the ecological dilemmas in their own regions. 

Based on these two ideas, I can envision a way which we might better address the ecological crisis. 

It would be based around a map, like a simple GIS. This map is created by the community of its users. What it displays are outlines of ecological problems and ecological solutions that people are undertaking. 

Consider a map scene with a city, a coast, a few inland environments. Inland, people are undertaking an ecological restoration project. On the map they have created a polygon which outlines their site. You can click on this polygon band learn about what exactly they are doing. What invasive species they are removing. What species they are planting. Etc. You can volunteer with them if you want.

Further inland there‚Äôs a forest. A polygon denotes a burn scar from a wildfire. The forest didn‚Äôt come back. However several different groups and organizations have tried to plant seedlings. Like a growing wiki page, if you click on the burn zone you can read about what each group did, about subsequent assessments of their success. The attributes of this polygon, which are a wiki, continue to grow as people work and add information about this site. Documenting the ecological state and the management actions that have been taken. 

Off the coast, several clickable layers exist. One denotes pollution from the city and watershed. It‚Äôs wiki includes a list of effects and possible solutions. One denotes a seagrass extent layer, and a seagrass restoration project. One denotes the habitat necessary for marine mammals that use this region. Another is a proposed marine reserve outline. At a series of clicks, one can learn in depth information about the local ecology, what threatens it, what‚Äôs being done, and if you can help out somehow. 

Within the city itself, several projects have formed. One is a pollinator habitat corridor. Self organized by citizens, business owners, even city officials. The system allows them to share info, species lists, seeds, observations, and coordinate at scale. (They‚Äôre solving for pattern). Another is a plan for where to plant trees to reduce the heat island effect. People use this space to pitch ideas to make the city more ecologically healthy and resilient. Even ideas to help it transition off of fossil fuels, improve food deserts, basically to deal with the problems of urban life (and especially urban life under climate change). 

Who would fill out this map? Ideally, first people who are involved in the science and applied work of ecology. As an ecological researcher myself, I personally would really love to share my work this way. And I‚Äôd love to explore, at a glance, what is going on around me. 

The amount of data that could be added to such a system over time would be incredible. It wouldn‚Äôt all be needed to be constantly displayed, but could interact with a freely searchable database. Something like Google Earth Engine does for remote sensing. You could search by location, or search by topic. Displaying data with a click, finding local work being done and opportunities to get involved with it yourself. 

This would be, in my estimation, a more effective way of sharing knowledge about ecology, about what we‚Äôre doing to manage ecology, and educating about what the issues are, and where. Instead of working in some silo, you have put your info of the sites and work you‚Äôve done up for anyone to find. And you can draw on a large quantity of other such info yourself. A naturally emergent cutting edge of how we approach ecological issues across spatial and temporal scales would emerge, and work done would feed back into the value of the system with case studies and examples and results and follow up surveys. 

‚Äî‚Äî

This is quite a radical idea, and for that I‚Äôve held it close to my chest for years. 

I‚Äôm sometimes hesitant to bring it up, it definitely invites some kind of quick derision when someone proposes something that is really big and encompassing. 

Yet the more I see in ecology, in working in the field, in growing to learn about more of the world, and the issues we face in it, the value I see in such an idea only grows. 

It has some problems. The centralized nature of it would be a real break with how we do things now. (But sometimes centralization of data is good. I think of Wikipedia here again. It has value that that info is not scattered across 10,000 blogs and encyclopedias. I think of Google Earth Engine, which acts as a platform for interactive work with vast repositories of spatial data). Another issue, in being an organizational platform that essentially tried to subsume the work other organizations into one place, it‚Äôs kind of running into the [‚Äúthere are 14 standards‚Äù](https://xkcd.com/927/) problem xkcd comics pointed out. There are other issues to. Overall, it‚Äôs just a really big crazy idea, and those often dont work. 

But I still see so much potential value there. The extinction and climate crises are becoming very real to me as of late. And I feel like I‚Äôm just ‚Äúwriting the obituary of nature‚Äù at times, as Enric Sala said. Other times, I feel that I am working in some silo. With little connection to what is going on out there for consevation. Perhaps connecting and communicating this movement could be what‚Äôs needed to truly cause the deeper shift that is needed to make it successful. 

I mostly write this here to organize my thoughts, and hopefully someone out there will have a bit of helpful feedback for me. If you‚Äôre interested in this idea, discuss a bit here, or connect with me somehow. Cheers!",1626438595

Abstract: 
    
Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) have been proposed to mitigate the impact of agriculture on both taxonomic and functional biodiversity. However, a better knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the loss of agrobiodiversity is needed to implement efficient AES. An unbalanced effort on research towards arable lands compared to permanent crops, and on fauna relative to plants, is patent, which limits the generalization of AES effectiveness.

We evaluated the effects of agricultural management and landscape simplification on taxonomic and functional diversity of the ground herb cover of 40 olive groves. We use a recently developed approach based on Hill numbers (rare, common and dominant species based) to analyze taxonomic and functional dissimilarity between farms with contrasting agricultural practices, and its potential attenuation by landscape complexity. We further explore the filtering effect of agricultural intensification on functional traits, and the relationship between functional and species richness across landscapes.

We found that taxonomic and functional dissimilarity of herb assemblages between intensively and low-intensively managed fields was mainly due to rare species. Dissimilarity decreased as landscape complexity increased, evidencing that complex landscapes attenuate the impact of agriculture intensification on herb assemblage composition. Agricultural intensification favoured more functionally homogeneous assemblages and disfavoured the herbs pollinated by insects, while it did not seem to affect wind-pollinated species.

Overall, functional richness increased exponentially with species richness across landscapes, but the latter was insufficient to drive any clear enhancement in functional richness in simple landscapes. In contrast, high species richness accelerated the enhancement in functional richness in intermediate and complex landscapes. These results highlight the functional filtering that intensive agriculture has generated for decades in homogeneous olive-dominated landscapes.

Synthesis and applications: Herb cover is essential to support the fauna of permanent croplands and their sustainable production. Hence, Agri-Environmental Schemes (AES) in these croplands should promote management practices favouring the diversity and functionality of herb assemblages. Such AES should be particularly prioritized in homogeneous landscapes, where ground herb cover composition and function has long been homogenized to a great extent.",1626056414

85,ecology,Why saving the rivers is so important," 

Water pollution is killing about 2 million people a year and make sick up to a billion. Low-income communities are the ones at most rink as they are closer to the most polluted areas and industries. While we are all enduring to overcome the current Pandemic, water pollution is creating the perfect broth for waterborne pathogens, bacteria and viruses from human and animal waste.

[H2O is a tribute to water through Ivan Mikolji‚Äôs photographs](https://preview.redd.it/sr2j88b87ma71.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d9167070c9430455b5db8b5ada25044d16d8d84)

[Our rivers](https://www.mikolji.com/h2o-portfolio/), reservoirs, lakes, and seas are drowning in chemicals, waste, plastic, and other pollutants. While the reason to save them is always oriented to ""We humans need water to live"" we often forget about the biodiversity we are destroying.

As river explorer [Ivan Mikolji](https://www.mikolji.com/about/cause/) says: ""You cannot preserve something that you don‚Äôt know exists"". It's crazy to think we are in 2021 and there are countless of species we still don't know about. People like Mr. Mikolji and his team are working hard to spread awareness about our surrounding biosphere in an attempt to achieve a fair trade-off between humans and nature.

With more than a hundred expeditions and innumerable publications in different countries, Mikolji has documented the magnificent diversity and wonders of the South American freshwater ecosystems. The philosophy that moves his creative will is the urgency to preserve the aquatic ecosystems of the planet, and as a first step he considers it necessary to make known the richness and beauty of these biomes.

I have been trying to source a fact that I am recalling from undergrad: generally speaking, ‚Äúthe average mature tree in the Amazon supports approximately 1,000 different species.‚Äù Has anyone heard a metric like this before? It stuck in my brain when I first came across it but I cannot validate it these days and I can‚Äôt seem to find it in my notes from the time.

I hope I am not making it up! If it is a real fact I hope to use it as a guide to graduate programs. If anyone can confirm this or provide some source material relevant, I‚Äôd appreciate it!",1625753479
2,ecology,Arctic: a new zone of geopolitical confrontation,"The interest in the Arctic region has increased dramatically. Global  warming was one of its main prerequisites. The icebergs that once  drowned the ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù are defrosting. In Danish Greenland, the melting  of island‚Äôs ice sheet increased intensity. Permafrost began to thaw in  the great spaces of the Russian Far North.

In turn, melting of underwater permafrost in the seas of the Eastern  Arctic accelerated twofold compared with the previous century, and  reached 18 centimeters per year. As a result, the thinned layer of  underwater permafrost came close to the methane zone. This led to the  destabilization of the area and massive emissions of the greenhouse gas  methane. If this continues, release of only 1% of the methane reserves  from the shelf of the seas of the Eastern Arctic into the atmosphere  will critically change the climate on the entire planet.

But if geologists, oceanographers, ecologists and many other  professions treat the North Pole region as an indicator of current  climate change process, then the world‚Äôs leading politicians turned  their eyes to the Arctic as a zone of potential conflicts.

At Geneva meeting on June 16, 2021, the presidents of the United  States and Russia mentioned the Arctic among the many different topics  discussed. Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin agreed to hold talks on the  Arctic, the delimitation of the lines of influence in the region,  possible partial demilitarization of a number of Arctic zones and  environmental cooperation.

Since China has become the prevalent direction of US foreign policy,  Washington needs to achieve at least temporary stabilization in all  other problem areas. The priority of the Biden administration will be  the implementation of new strategies to counter the global influence of  the PRC (in response to the repression in Hong Kong, to the use of  ‚Äúlabor camps‚Äù in Xinjiang, daring operations in cyberspace and massive  theft of intellectual property). Therefore, it is important for  Washington to reduce the growing conflict potential of the Arctic  region.

On the one hand, the rapidly melting ice opens up previously  unprecedented opportunities in the Arctic for the development of  minerals in the coastal zone, on the shelf and at the bottom of the  Arctic Ocean. On the other hand, not all the Arctic continental shelf  territories have clear boundaries despite they are assigned to the  United States, Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway. Generally speaking,  the Russian Federation pins high hopes on the Arctic region regarding  the growth of its geo-economic influence, and the United States shall  not allow an increase of the Russia‚Äôs and China‚Äôs influence in the  Arctic.

In May 2021, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken made a special  northern tour ‚Äì he visited Denmark, Greenland and Iceland, urging the  need to neutralize the increased ambitions of the Russian Federation and  China in the Arctic. On May 17, he visited the former US/NATO Keflavik  airbase (Iceland) and negotiated the deployment of US Navy P-8 Poseidon  Maritime Surveillance Aircraft (although the Pentagon decided to resume  operation of this airbase due to the increasing Russian military  activity, back in 2015).

On May 19, A. Blinken arrived to Reykjavik, where a meeting of the  foreign ministers of the Arctic Council took place which includes eight  Arctic countries ‚Äì five coastal states plus Iceland, Sweden and Finland,  as well as six organizations of Arctic indigenous peoples. Today, the  Arctic Council is the main platform for resolving issues related to the  territories around the North Pole.

During the meeting, the temporary chairmanship of the Arctic Council  transited from Iceland to Russia for two years (until May 2023). A draft  strategic plan for the Arctic Council for the next 10 years was  released. Issues of cooperation between the countries of the region, of  coordination of actions for ensuring the development of the Arctic,  protection of the environment, culture, traditions and languages of the  indigenous peoples of the region were discussed.

Also, eight Arctic Council member states discussed the feasibility of  expanding the activities of another international platform ‚Äì the  International Arctic Forum, whose members are the five coastal states of  the Arctic region (USA, Canada, Russia, Denmark and Norway), while  Iceland, Sweden and Finland are only attempting to become full members  of this organization (having the status of observer countries so far).

Although the transition of the two-year chairmanship of the Arctic  Council from Iceland to Russia is a routine bureaucratic procedure, the  rest of the member countries of this organization are seriously  concerned about the Russian Federation‚Äôs attempts to use its right to  form the current agenda for rough and overt promotion of its own  expansionist interests. At least this is how Moscow has been acting on  the international arena for the past 7 years. Washington believes that  now the Arctic can be another area of geopolitical confrontation  alongside those between the United States and the Russian Federation in  Syria (and the Middle East), Libya (and Central Africa), Venezuela (and  Latin America), and Ukraine (and the post-Soviet space).

The greatest concern in this regard is expressed by the Kingdom of  Norway, since Moscow and Oslo are in serious controversies over the  Svalbard archipelago. According to international law, Svalbard is part  of Norway, however, Russia claims its right of economic exploitation of  the polar archipelago and its shelf zone.

The representative of the Russian Federation in the Arctic Council  Nikolay Korchunov said that ‚Äú¬Ä¬úthe Svalbard issue is not  multidimensional, since it is not interesting for Canada and the United  States. Accordingly, the agenda of the Arctic Council will include those  issues which fell within the scope of interest of all eight countries  of this organization. That is, issues related to the archipelago will  remain the subject of bilateral dialogue between Russia and Norway.‚Äù¬Ä¬ù  At the same time, it is possible that Oslo will not want to remain  one-on-one with an unpredictable and aggressive Moscow and will make  every effort to involve both Ottawa and Washington in resolving this  issue.

According to both the Norwegian AldriMer newspaper and the Russian  liberal opposition Novaya Gazeta newspaper, starting at least from 2016,  some armed people regularly appeared in the Svalbard archipelago, which  is, like its coastal waters, a demilitarized zone. Moreover, it is  alleged that, having changed into civilian clothes, Russian fighters  disembarked even on mainland Norway. The outlets referred to four  sources in three countries, Norwegian counterintelligence and US  intelligence.

The case is regular servicemen of the Russian special forces (from  the Armed Forces and ‚ÄúRosgvardia‚Äù), as well as representatives of  mercenary formations ‚Äì PMC Wagner and ‚ÄúKadyrov‚Äôs detachment‚Äù.

In particular, we are talking about Chechen militants who are  personally subordinate to the odious leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.  A separate webpage on the website of the Russian Special Forces  University, the only private university in the Russian Federation, where  professional security officials are trained (Chechnya, Gudermes), is  devoted to the Arctic exercises of the ‚Äú¬Ä¬úKadyrov‚Äôs squad‚Äù¬Ä¬ù. In 2018,  R. Kadyrov personally bragged about the participation of Chechen  fighters in exercises in Murmansk and Franz Josef Land, however, he  prudently did not mention his fighters‚Äô¬Ä¬ô illegal visit to the territory  of Norway.

The only airport in Svalbard falls under control of Norway.  Therefore, the Russian military arrives at the archipelago on the P-650  special-purpose midget submarine submarine, intended for the covert  transfer of manpower to the rear of the enemy. This allows them  remaining unnoticed for a some time, until the Norwegian authorities  will learn about the landing of the Russian troops.

Based on the above, it is quite understandable why the official Oslo  is so concerned with Russia√¢¬Ä¬ôs two-years presidency in the Arctic  Council. At the same time, Norway (as well as other Arctic countries) is  likely to place hopes on the US President J. Biden‚Äô¬Ä¬ôs preparedness to  confrontation with authoritarian Russia, and therefore will prevent it  from making any proposals on the current agenda that contradict the  interests of democratic states.

tldr: conserving agrobiodiversity through indigenous seeds by the community, for the community.

I am a graduate student -- with a love of biodiversity and permaculture -- working at IIRR, a Philippines-based NGO at the forefront of regenerative and agroecological approaches since the 1990s.

Over decades, IIRR has accumulated a collection of such indigenous crops and cultivars which has been maintained (in vivo) in the 3,500 sqm campus ‚Äúcrop museum‚Äù with 52 types of vegetables with 183 varieties; 15 kinds of fruit trees with 21 varieties; and 8 types of herbs with 9 varieties.

Using the genetic resources grown in the crop museum, IIRR has worked with communities to establish additional crop museums (200-square-meters each) at 300 schools strategically located across the Philippines to conserve agrobiodiversity of native plants, educate the youth on science and ecology through gardening, boost nutrition with healthy indigenous crops, and strengthen community food systems. This is accomplished through crop museums serving as learning hubs, action-research sites, and seed propagation centers for the generation of seeds for native plants to be distributed freely to school and community gardens.

We had a few grants to do this work in the past, but the pandemic has made financing hard to come by. We are running a [crowdfunding initiative to help build more crop museums](https://fundrazr.com/cropmuseum) to protect agrobiodiversity in a country that has been heavily affected by over-introduction and importation of new varieties for commercial planting. Anything you may be able to contribute would be incredibly appreciated, along with sharing the link to the fundraiser.

Thank you so much for your time and support. ps CHECK OUT THE PHOTOS!

Abstract: Investigation of communities in extreme environments with unique conditions has the potential to broaden or challenge existing theory as to how biological communities assemble and change through succession. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems have strong, parallel gradients of nutrients and environmental stress, and present unusual conditions in early succession, in that both nutrient availability and stressors are high. We analyzed the succession of the invertebrate community at 9¬∞50‚Ä≤ N on the East Pacific Rise for 11 yr following an eruption in 2006 in order to test successional theories developed in other ecosystems. We focused on functional traits including body size, external protection, provision of habitat (foundation species), and trophic mode to understand how the unique nutritional and stress conditions influence community composition. In contrast to established theory, large, fast-growing, structure-forming organisms colonized rapidly at vents, while small, asexually reproducing organisms were not abundant until later in succession. Species in early succession had high external protection, as expected in the harsh thermal and chemical conditions after the eruption. Changes in traits related to feeding ecology and dispersal potential over succession agreed with expectations from other ecosystems. We also tracked functional diversity metrics over time to see how they compared to species diversity. While species diversity peaked at 8 yr post-eruption, functional diversity was continuing to increase at 11 yr. Our results indicate that deep-sea hydrothermal vents have distinct successional dynamics due to the high stress and high nutrient conditions in early succession. These findings highlight the importance of extending theory to new systems and considering function to allow comparison between ecosystems with different species and environmental conditions.",1625451867

32,ecology,Scared shitless,"I've been sitting out here inhaling news and articles for the last 3hrs. I came back up for air and am scared shitless.

... this heatwave scares me so much. I have made a study of collapsing systems all my life, they all collapse in the same way exponentially.

People have it in their heads that it's going to take hundreds of years for all the ice to melt. This is a false presumption. As all systems collapse they slowly build energy until they hit a point where the system can not handle it and then it all falls apart suddenly.

We have feedback loops feeding into this collapsing environmental system we live in, more and more energy is being dumped into the process exponentially on top of our yearly output of 20,000 megatons of greenhouse energy. 

We need to be developing a plan and executing an orderly retreat from our coastlines. Anything under 350ft of current sea level and where it can flow into lowland areas must be evacuated in the next 25-50yrs.

Watch the news over the next 5yrs as scientist begin to stare into the abyss that is a global level event, not seen since the precambrian age. U can't dump that much fresh water into the oceans in such a short amount of time without killing off most of the saltwater macro and micro life in the path of that flow and the subsequent new salinity of the oceans.

We also can't shift that much tonnage on our mantle without squeezing stuff out underneath like toothpaste.

Our ancient ancestors who passed on knowledge through word of mouth through our history across all cultures have warned over and over again. This planet is not a slow lumbering beast. No! When it moves it moves in ways that bring the fear of the Gods\God into them, apocalypse, cataclysm, every culture have made words to encompass events that are so large in scale they horrify and boggle the mind. Walls of water 500-1000ft high flowing down from the north about 12,000yrs ago erasing nearly all evidence of humanity's existence on all the coasts and in it's flow path.

The grand canyon was not carved over millions of years. Try under 5yrs. Only time in my life I have ever seen straight walls in water flow paths is when it is moving like a freight train relative to it's scale. Water is scale invariant, what occurs on the micro occurs in the macro. Grand canyon last I remember does not have many spots where it breaks off into a 45degree slope indicative of a period of lazy flow...

Worse yet a harbinger from the heavens will reveal itself to our eyes in 2031, we got a massive object incoming. I don't seeing it posing any threat to the planet (unless it's dragging pepper shot in it's wake that gets flung at us as it interacts with other planets..) but the ancient's obsessiveness over astral phenomenon .. idk.

For me way too many things are lining up and setting off alot of alarm bells in my head. Ground temps in Siberia Alaska Canada all hitting perfect composting temps, volcanic and tectonic activity rising over the last decade as water tonnage is being shifted around, feed back loops, the ongoing largest recorded mass migration of humanity northwards, back to back to back to back record breaking heat and extreme weather events, and now a large comet that is going to streak through our solar system in 2031.  Which is about right at the midway point where I predict shit is going to hit the fan. 

We hit the point of no return 2013 ago when Hawaii announced going past 400ppm. On the outside I've been predicting we had 40yrs from that point on the outside when we start seeing cities across the globe getting erased from the map.

We will be lucky as a species if there are any humans around 150yrs from now, to tell stories around a hearthfire in their hovels.
 Of God's that flew around the planet in chariots, wielding weapons of light against each other. Who's anger with each other and man was so great, they called upon the power of the sun to turn night into day. Unleashing cataclysm on the earth washing away the great coastal cities of man, and bringing a rain that lasted 50yrs washing away the rest. Leaving behind the enigmatic glass lakes of death as a warning to those that may anger them again.

Sure the story might not be an accurate timeline of events, I doubt anyone who survives it will be able to piece together anything of what happened after 2-3generations..

I worry so much about this.. This is the crap that has consumed my mind for over 26yrs.

I see no hope, we are in the shadow of the valley.

God help us all, God have mercy on the generations that come long after us. They will curse our names if there is anything that survives, to show we once existed.",1625205095

Abstract: Ecological forecasts are quantitative tools that can guide ecosystem management. The co-emergence of extensive environmental monitoring and quantitative frameworks allows for widespread development and continued improvement of ecological forecasting systems. We use a relatively simple estuarine hypoxia model to demonstrate advances in addressing some of the most critical challenges and opportunities of contemporary ecological forecasting, including predictive accuracy, uncertainty characterization, and management relevance. We explore the impacts of different combinations of forecast metrics, drivers, and driver time windows on predictive performance. We also incorporate multiple sets of state-variable observations from different sources and separately quantify model prediction error and measurement uncertainty through a flexible Bayesian hierarchical framework. Results illustrate the benefits of 1) adopting forecast metrics and drivers that strike an optimal balance between predictability and relevance to management, 2) incorporating multiple data sources in the calibration dataset to separate and propagate different sources of uncertainty, and 3) using the model in scenario mode to probabilistically evaluate the effects of alternative management decisions on future ecosystem state. In the Chesapeake Bay, the subject of this case study, we find that average summer or total annual hypoxia metrics are more predictable than monthly metrics and that measurement error represents an important source of uncertainty. Application of the model in scenario mode suggests that absent watershed management actions over the past decades, long-term average hypoxia would have increased by 7% compared to 1985. Conversely, the model projects that if management goals currently in place to restore the Bay are met, long-term average hypoxia would eventually decrease by 32% with respect to the mid-1980s.",1625106325

 I'm a vegetarian and told him that a plane flight is 50 wasted vegetarian lives. 

That it would be good if he did train than boat or train to idk madrid, then plane.

 But he said that his family took a thousand years to agree, it is not easy in terms of leaves, they must all arrive at the same time and plane cost less according to him. 

I don't know how to convince him. I would love so much that the government would ban travel in plane when we were thepeople. 

We are all children, if we want something we do everything to opt for it and too bad for the consequences. We need a clear restriction. But the government has no balls for the environment.",1625051741

&amp;#x200B;

Legal experts from around the world have developed a ""historic"" definition of ecocide, which is intended to be adopted by the international criminal court to prosecute the most heinous crimes against the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

The bill, introduced Tuesday, defines ecocide as ""unlawful or capricious acts committed with the knowledge that there is a substantial probability that those acts will cause serious, widespread or lasting damage to the environment.""

&amp;#x200B;

The Stop Ecocide Foundation initiative comes amid concerns that not enough is being done to address the climate and ecological crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

If adopted by ICC members, it would become the fifth crime prosecuted by the court, along with war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression, and the first new international crime since the decade. 1940, when Nazi leaders were tried in Nuremberg.",1624916101

Expertos jur√≠dicos de todo el mundo han elaborado una definici√≥n ‚Äúhist√≥rica‚Äù de ecocidio, que pretende ser adoptada por el corte penal internacional para enjuiciar los delitos m√°s atroces contra el medio ambiente.

El proyecto de ley, presentado el martes, define el ecocidio como ‚Äúactos il√≠citos o caprichosos cometidos con el conocimiento de que existe una probabilidad sustancial de que esos actos causen da√±os graves, generalizados o duraderos al medio ambiente‚Äù.

La iniciativa Stop Ecocide Foundation surge en medio de preocupaciones de que no se est√° haciendo lo suficiente para abordar la crisis clim√°tica y ecol√≥gica.

Si lo adoptan los miembros de la CPI, se convertir√≠a en el quinto delito que procesa el tribunal, junto con los cr√≠menes de guerra, los cr√≠menes de lesa humanidad, el genocidio y el crimen de agresi√≥n, y el primer crimen internacional nuevo desde la d√©cada de 1940, cuando los l√≠deres nazis fueron procesados ‚Äã‚Äãen Nuremberg.

Abstract: Species co-occurrences in local communities can arise independent or dependent on species‚Äô niches. However, the role of niche-dependent processes has not been thoroughly deciphered when generalized to biogeographical scales, probably due to combined shortcomings of data and methodology. Here, we explored the influence of environmental filtering and limiting similarity, as well as biogeographical processes that relate to the assembly of species‚Äô communities and co-occurrences. We modelled jointly the occurrences and co-occurrences of 1016 tropical tree species with abundance data from inventories of 574 localities in eastern South America. We estimated species co-occurrences as raw and residual associations with models that excluded and included the environmental effects on the species‚Äô co-occurrences, respectively. Raw associations indicate co-occurrence of species, whereas residual associations indicate co-occurrence of species after accounting for shared responses to environment. Generally, the influence of environmental filtering exceeded that of limiting similarity in shaping species‚Äô co-occurrences. The number of raw associations was generally higher than that of the residual associations due to the shared responses of tree species to the environmental covariates. Contrary to what was expected from assuming limiting similarity, phylogenetic relatedness or functional similarity did not limit tree co-occurrences. The proportions of positive and negative residual associations varied greatly across the study area, and we found a significant tendency of some biogeographical regions having higher proportions of negative associations between them, suggesting that large-scale biogeographical processes limit the establishment of trees and consequently their co-occurrences.",1624246104

Abstract: The negative relationship between body size and population density in mammals is often interpreted as resulting from energetic constraints. In a global change scenario, however, this relationship might be expected to change, given the size-dependent nature of anthropogenic pressures and vulnerability to extinction. Here we test whether the size-density relationship (SDR) in mammals has changed over the last 50 years. We show that the relationship has shifted down and became shallower, corresponding to a decline in population density of 31‚Äì73%, for the largest and smallest mammals, respectively. However, the SDRs became steeper in some groups (e.g. carnivores) and shallower in others (e.g. herbivores). The Anthropocene reorganisation of biotic systems is apparent in macroecological relationships, reinforcing the notion that biodiversity pattens are contingent upon conditions at the time of investigation. We call for an increased attention to the role of global change on macroecological inferences.",1623639729

62,ecology,Currently a Graphic Designer. How do I change careers to Fungal Ecology/Forest Pathology?,"**TL;DR**

I currently work in Graphic Design and want to earn a Masters in Ecology. I need more undergraduate schooling to do so, already have loans, and don't know what the best strategy to get there is.

# [Some backstory on my current situation]

I am 23, and have been working full time in graphic design for the past year and a half. I have a degree in Software Engineering and minored in Graphic Design. Corporate life and the tech space in general is not fulfilling. Work pays well, isn't too difficult and my coworkers are kind, but I dread work most days. I don't have a desire to work my way up in the field of design, and I struggle to scrounge together any semblance of desire to write code.

My dream is to spend time working in the field or even in a lab, and ideally become a professor one day. I think about it all day at the office. I listen to podcasts and audiobooks about fungi and forest pathology and dream of what my life could one day become. I'd really like to make an impact on the lives of others and potentially unearth discoveries about the importance of fungi and their relationship with soil and plants. I want to do professional research. They have so much potential to change our world. I have been growing mushrooms of all kinds since the pandemic began, reading book after book about them, and cannot seem to satiate my desire for more knowledge about fungi. **I'd like to purse a masters degree in Ecology or Forest Pathology.**

&amp;#x200B;

# [Here is the problem]

I have about $18k worth of student loans to pay back, and I cannot pursue a graduate degree in ecology with my current bachelors (I have a number of prerequisites to complete before I would be eligible).

***That being said,***

My cost of living is very low, I live in a double income household and we plan on never having children. I don't dream of a nice car or fancy home- I'd just like to have a means of supporting myself that fulfills my love for fungi and desire to help the planet and other people on it. I'm ready to work my ass off for this goal.

&amp;#x200B;

# [Here are some possible solutions]

&amp;#x200B;

***1.) Pursue a bachelors in Ecology part time while I work.***

I pursue another bachelors right away, and then go for a masters. My student loans would maybe go on deferment for those \~6+ years, and some of my credits would transfer to the new bachelors.

&amp;#x200B;

***2.) Work towards paying off loans before beginning a new degree.***

The world of design is still rather new to me, and there is room to work my way up and land a job that could potentially pay off my loans even faster. I'm not sure a bachelors in Ecology would open any doors to higher income than my current degree will earn me, and the thought of paying for 6 more years of schooling is scary to me. But then again so is the thought of working in an office for the rest of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

***3.) Some other method I have not thought of.***

I'm sure there are other possible routes to get where I want to be in my professional life that I am blind to.

&amp;#x200B;

**I need help weighing the positives and negatives of these solutions and am looking for advice about other possibilities.**",1623355763

Abstract: Western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a major pest of maize in the United States and is an invasive pest in Europe. Maize is the only agricultural crop on which western corn rootworm larvae can survive and this insect requires two consecutive years of maize cultivation to complete its life cycle. Transgenic maize producing insecticidal proteins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is often used to manage rootworm populations. The first Bt trait, Cry3Bb1, was introduced in 2003, but larval resistance to this toxin appeared in northeastern Iowa in 2009. Rootworm management occurs on a field-by-field basis, but adult rootworm may disperse among fields. It is known that growing consecutive years of Cry3Bb1 maize within a field can lead to resistance, but the relationship of the surrounding landscape to the development of resistance is unknown. Using geospatial tools and publicly available land-use data, we examined circular areas (buffers) surrounding fields that had previously experienced high levels of rootworm injury to Cry3Bb1 maize and rootworm resistance to Cry3Bb1 maize (problem fields). We calculated the proportion of area inside each buffer planted to maize continuously for 1‚Äì9 yr, and compared these values to those for randomly selected control points throughout the state. We also calculated the proportion of the state planted to maize for at least three consecutive years for 2003 through 2018, and its relationship with the annual value of maize. We found that areas surrounding problem fields had significantly more continuous maize compared to controls, with the most continuous maize within 1.6 km of problem fields. We also found that the cultivation of continuous maize in Iowa increased significantly between 2003 and 2018, and this was correlated with average annual price of maize. We hypothesize a scenario in which continuous cultivation of Cry3Bb1 maize in local landscapes, driven in part by the increased value of maize, facilitated selection for Cry3Bb1 resistance. These results suggest that land use in areas surrounding problem fields affect the rate of resistance evolution and approaches for resistance management can be enhanced by taking a landscape-level perspective.",1623033163

Abstract: Functional traits are often used to examine ecological patterns and processes. Ontogeny‚Äîchanges that occur over time as the result of development‚Äîgenerates variation in traits within individual organisms. We aimed to quantify the role of ontogeny in structuring functional trait variation across a range of co-existing herbaceous perennial species and hypothesized that ontogenetic variation in traits would be greater in younger vs. older plants. We grew eight herbaceous perennial forb species common in tallgrass prairies from seed in a greenhouse in Madison, Wisconsin, USA to determine how and when time-related variation in functional traits is large relative to other sources of variation, such as differences between leaves and species. We destructively measured common functional traits on four individuals of each species every two weeks for 19 weeks, including leaf mass fraction, root mass fraction, stem mass fraction, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf area. We found that most functional traits indeed change through time, that the direction of many changes are consistent between species but the magnitude of change is species specific, and most time-related variation occurred earlier in development. These results emphasize the importance of considering sampling timing and differences between young and old plants when measuring functional traits. Our results suggest that ontogenetic intraspecific variation can be substantial, especially early in life. It may be problematic to use traits measured from mature plants to interpret the importance of processes that occur at earlier life stages or vice versa; using seedling traits to understand adult plant responses may also be inappropriate.",1622431908

Who‚Äôs the apex predator at different ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of an ecosystem? In a square meter of grass or on a tree, it would be the beetle, one that eats wood, roots, or other insects. At the scale of a 100 square kilometers of forest, bears and lynx and wolves and eagles share the top, as few things hunt them and they hunt everything else.

But what about the scale of 1 or 2 acres? Bears and wolves and the like spend relatively little time in these areas because their ranges are so much larger. Birds may be present but as part of a somewhat closed system, all of these spend too much time elsewhere to fully shape the small ecosystem. That‚Äôs why I think reptiles are the kings of the ‚Äúsmall forest‚Äù. They have little reason or means to go much further than this, and so carve out a niche as the top consumer. The small rodents that eat the grass may be eaten by a snake. The insects and worms that dissolve leaves and feces and nibble on tree roots are eaten by lizards. If there‚Äôs not space enough for an apex predator, reptiles seem to fit the bill well for the prime consumer.",1622261617

Which species should I prioritze inventoring when I have very few knowledge and experience (botanic)?,"I'm a student in nature preservation and I'm trying to inventory plant species in different areas around me. My local plant preservation organization has a document online which you print and fill on the field. I then report every species I recognise.

I have very little knowledge of botanic and use a fantastic guide that my uncle borrowed me, with almost every plant from my area, drawn in color and described. This is very useful to recognize the most common plants, but I'm rather on the edge of the area treated in the guide, so not every plant is there. 

A simpler problem is when the plant doesn't have flowers yet/anymore I can't identify it with my guide or an app. 

For example, as an exercise, my uncle (who's a botanist) told me to inventory my grandma's garden. I did so and found 25 different species (almost all had flowers) but when he corrected my list he found 25 more (almost all without flowers yet). So I basically found half less of what there was.

Are my filled forms useless if I don't have the majority of species present ? Will it damage the data ? Or is any data good to take ? In that case, what plants should I prioritze when inventoring (I have no idea what plant is rare or not until after when I come back home and look at each new species individually in the online databases)?

The standards by which cultivators of crops, including the emerging plant of increasing import - Cannabis sativa, fertigate, or provide nutrients, are often erroneous - albeit improving - as optimal production is a crucial metric across scales. 

Often,  plant growth and performance are hampered as one or more components of the consortia of realms that encompass plant nutrition is overlooked or incompletely understood.   

The central quantifiable tendencies for nutrition in plant biology are linked here to ecological research and experience cultivating cannabis as a bulwark from which to optimize growth, development, biomass production, and of course, the production of those secondary metabolites - Cannabinoids and terpenes.

Abstract: Individuals that disperse long distances from their natal site must select breeding patches with no prior knowledge of patch suitability. Despite decades of theoretical studies examining which cues dispersing individuals should use to select breeding patches, few empirical studies have tested the predictions of these theories at spatial scales relevant to long-distance dispersal in wild animal populations. Here, we use a novel assignment model based on multiple intrinsic markers to quantify natal dispersal distances of Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) breeding in forest fragments. We show that long-distance natal dispersal in this species is more frequent than commonly assumed for songbirds and that habitat selection by these individuals is driven by density-dependence and patch quality but not the amount of habitat surrounding breeding patches. These results represent an important contribution to understanding habitat selection by dispersing individuals, especially with regards to long-distance dispersal.",1621825392

Thing is even after playing by chevrons underhanded rules, even after  two decades, after over 250 visits to Ecuador from his home in NYC against an army of over 2k Chevron lawyers from various top firms... he  won the case on behalf of the 30k indigenous people he represented.. 

Supreme and international courts all ruled that beyond a shadow of doubt Chevron was guilty. Resulting in a historic 9.5 billion dollar judgement to repair and clean up the damage they did. 

But instead of paying Chevron packed up left Ecuador to begin it's retaliation in Donzinger. They got  Southern District federal judge Kaplan (former big tobacco lawyer) to charge Donzinger with fraud. When Judge Kaplan requested the DA to take the case they flat out refused. Then in an unprecedented move Kaplan appointed Chevrons private lawyers to act as  state prosecutors in a criminal case. Making it  so now our tax dollars are paying millions to Chevrons private lawyers to act as state prosecutors. 

The witness they brought who claimed Donzinger bribed a judge later in court admitted he lied in his testimony and was paid over 2 million dollars by Chevron to do so.

Having failed there Kaplan ordered (breaking procedure) that Donzinger hand over his cellphone and laptop t9 Chevrons lawyers

When Donzinger successfully appealed the order Kaplan went ballistic. He held Donzinger in contempt of court. Disbarred him. strapped an ankle bracelet on him and placed him under house arrest where he remains now serving nearly two years. 

After  international outcry from lawyers, human rights observers activists and Nobel Laureates Kaplan recused himself but not before personally appointing his replacement federalist Judge Preska. (Also breaking procedure)

Brings us to now. Along with connections to Chevron Preska has4 times denied requests to lift Donzingers house arrest.Shes denied a jury in a criminal trial. She denied public or zoom hearings. Even denied the request of the US legal ambassador  appointed by Obama (oversees war crimes and human rights cases globally) to observe the hearings. Denied Donzinger to testify on his own behalf. Denied over half of his witnesses to testify. And recently during witness testimony she blatantly distracted herself to read a newspaper.

Yesterday was his last hearing. We had rallys at the NY fed court on pearl every morning before the hearing. To hear from Donzinger Roger Waters Marianne Williamson Susan Suranden orgs activists and attorneys showed up in strong but relatively small numbers.   Now what's left is submitting written final statements then she'll make her ‚Äúruling"" Despite having a pro bono defense  with legendary lawyers Martin Garbus and Ron Kuby this kangaroo court has made up it's mind.

""Donziger Defense Team Rests Its Case After 10 Minutes, Calls No Witnesses | New York Law Journal"" https://www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2021/05/17/donziger-defense-team-rests-its-case-after-10-minutes-calls-no-witnesses/?slreturn=20210418074024


So why all this. Because even after being an environmental and human rights activist since 07 and feeling well informed I really found out about this at the start of this year. Finally getting the gist from El Chapo Traphouse of all places. So like you and most of even the relatively awake world no one has a clue. Not a single major media outlet had reported on this. The nytimes which is about 30 min walk from where Donziger lives has not written a single thing. Not CNN not msm no one expect some independent media outlets. Like the times t board member happens to also on chevrons board. 

Lastly even if you made it this far this isn't about Chevron or even Donziger.  And it's not just about the serious crimes in Ecuador. This is about quitely putting away human rights lawyers. Especially lawyers who can not only win against Chevron but against all the companies responsible for spills and damages to our natives from the pipeline. Or  communities with growing fracking pipelines. Like the ones going through  my city in Brooklyn and the Rockaways. The fracking pipelines all over the country. 

If this goes by without anyone noticing our legal system  will be completely managed by private entities. Any whistleblower, advocate, unions, fair standards, or  liability issues  will be settled before trial in courts bought by corporations.

It's  decades in the making. Right now it's comings to a pivtoal point that will reshape any pretense of justice in a matter of days

Donzinger will most likely unjustly go to jail. We will have standards of human right falling below most totalitarian nations. Or we can spread this out. Get it known go above our shit major news outlets that gave us the Iraq War and even now silence us on Palestinians until we turned it on. Turn it on",1621389011

It's easy to observe that these beaches are as good as dead : no plants, (almost) no fishes due to swimmers, no insects, reptiles or any other lifeform except the occasional seashell and sand tick.

I find these ""ecosystems"" very poor in habitats variety : only sand above and below water, nothing else, the beach is usually perfectly clean of any debris or rocks that could provide shelter for animals. The constant population of tourists walking everywhere in the summer seems to scare away animals and doesn't allow plants to grow either.

But natural sand beaches do exist, so what is the difference with touristic ones, and are they any better in housing biodiversity ? 

If tourist beaches do indeed house very little biodiversity, is it a major problem in a global view, or us it anecdotal ?",1621247227

Abstract: The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is managed worldwide for honey production and crop pollination, and is an invasive species in many countries. Wild colonies occupy natural and human‚Äêmade cavities and are thought to impact other cavity‚Äêusing species. We reviewed documented evidence of wild A mellifera nesting sites globally via a literature review (27 relevant studies) and citizen‚Äêscience observations of wild honey bee colonies on iNaturalist (326 observations). Honey bee occupancy rates from published studies were typically low and occupation was often temporary. Citizen‚Äêscience data showed that most colonies in cavities had small or narrow entrance holes. Current evidence of perceived competition with honey bees in cavities is largely anecdotal and little is known about the long‚Äêterm impacts on survival and reproductive success of other cavity‚Äêoccupying species. To guide conservation policy and practice, more empirical research is needed to understand the ecological outcomes of competitive interactions in nesting cavities.",1621220794
46,ecology,What about land reclamation from the desert?,"I was watching some documentaries on Chinese history and found out they were reclaiming land from the deserts with forestation etc. This was happening in 2000 BCE! In fact, it's far from the only case in history, but it's very significant because this exact project enabled the creation of the Silk Way.

So why don't we do it now? What are the reasons? Buying CO2 credits is so cheap, why don't we have fewer deserts?   
When I want to offset my CO2 it's dirt cheap &amp; that's basically paying for trees to be planted. I know lots of this money is being siphoned and that I have to be paying probably 10x, but still... why do we even have deserts when we can paint them green with trees? Am I missing something?

\- Age: 21

\- Terrible at writing field reports

\- love animals/raising animals

&amp;#x200B;

I regret choosing Ecology as my major at University because I'm not actually that good at it, nor do I enjoy it. I'm worried I just have a pessimistic view of the subject because I don't get good grades in my major paper, and I generally do better in my range of elective papers that are subjects like molecular biology, GIS, Environmental Ethics...

I've always wanted to be a vet because I enjoy caring for animals. I had an internship at an Aquarium which I enjoyed, and the people who work there have a BSc in Marine Science (whereas my degree is just general Ecology). Where can I go with this degree that won't have me doing field research and reports??

My most recent assessment for my Terrestrial Ecology paper was a field report on Ecological Succession, and I felt so ashamed to submit absolute trash and part of me feels like a fraud that I'm going to be graduating with a major in Ecology even though I'm not even good at it or fully understand the subject. I was better at my ecology papers in first year which is what made me decide that's what is gonna be my major, without really thinking about the job opportunities. I hate R Studio and I cannot for the life of me understand the statistics behind the graphs I make and I think everyone with an Ecology degree knows how to use R Studio?? or is it just me?? :/

Is it too late to complete a vet degree? Or pursue a lowkey passion of health science and become a dermatologist or dentist??? I feel like I have wasted so much time and money, and my current degree won't be relevant to the other avenues I'd feel like I'd enjoy a lot more :((",1620878953

When that is done i hope to have a decent enough understanding on the governing factors of ecology to be of use in restoration efforts. The lab i currently work at is often commissioned as a third party for environmental restoration firms so i have a hint of a background in the field as of now. 

In what we call western societies, we have the privilege of preserving our natural landscapes (though this is under excersiced). In the united states we have been outsourcing slavery and environmental degredation by establishing industry and taking advantage of societies with weak labor rights and no provisions for protection of their natural landscapes ( a result of the current global capatalistic economic model).

Of course global economics and global industrialization aside, there are places that are suffering ecological collapse as satellite casualties of climate change. There are many other reasons for loss of habitat and environmental degredation writ large but the ultimate cause is usually anthropogenic activity. 

My goal (pipe dream) is to become extremely efficient and productive in grant writing and social organization. I want to identify at risk communities that would benefit most from restoration efforts. I would identity these areas based on how much of an impact my intervention would have on the social, economic, and environmental aspects of the specific ecology of the locations. 

My question is, in your opinion, what are the 'front lines' in need of ecological salvation? Where would a dollar go the farthest and lead to the most benefit? It could be anything from mercury mitigation in South American gold harvesting, re-establishing vegitation where desertification is taking place, introducing sustainable farming practices in Malaysian palm farms, anything.

I think this was accomplished by the more aggressive parasite chicks deterring small predators, and perhaps the parasite parents partially tending/defending the nest.

Abstract: Ecologists increasingly rely on complex computer simulations to forecast ecological systems. To make such forecasts precise, uncertainties in model parameters and structure must be reduced and correctly propagated to model outputs. Naively using standard statistical techniques for this task, however, can lead to bias and underestimation of uncertainties in parameters and predictions. Here, we explain why these problems occur and propose a framework for robust inference with complex computer simulations. After having identified that model error is more consequential in complex computer simulations, due to their more pronounced nonlinearity and interconnectedness, we discuss as possible solutions data rebalancing and adding bias corrections on model outputs or processes during or after the calibration procedure. We illustrate the methods in a case study, using a dynamic vegetation model. We conclude that developing better methods for robust inference of complex computer simulations is vital for generating reliable predictions of ecosystem responses.",1620008187

I'd like to take a cross-country road trip in the next few years and would love some recommendations of natural areas to explore. I'm a wildlife biology student, and have a passion for botany, mycology, geology, and everything else about the natural world. Are there any nature preserves/public lands/destinations in your state that you would recommend to someone driving through? I'm looking for spots that a naturalist might freak out over, but that are under the radar of regular tourists. For example, I'm from California and would recommend Mitchell Caverns in the Mojave desert, and Ma-l'el Dunes on the northcoast. Neither of those locations are going to show up if you google ""best natural attractions in CA"" but they are unmissable in my opinion!

58,ecology,Need help figuring out how to career-switch from Computer Science to Botany,"Title is the tl;dr, but here's some more context. I graduated from college with a BS in Computer Science a few years ago, and I've been working full-time as a programmer since then. I went with it in college because I needed financial independence from an abusive situation, and it did give me that, but it's not something I care about, the industry as a whole has some huge problems, and I'm finally in a place where I can actually think about what I WANT to do with my working life. Which is work with plants.   
I'm know I'm going to need a master's and potentially a PhD to make this possible, and I didn't take any of the life science classes the first time I did college. So where I'm at right now is taking classes one or two a semester, at a local community college, to get the background I'd need to even apply to graduate programs.   
**What courses do I definitely need to take to have a chance at grad school?** I know chem and bio are on the list, and Environmental Science. Would an Earth Science/Geology class be relevant? Would I need to take a Statistics class or is it enough that I know stats? Would it be useful for me to learn R, or GIS, or any of the environmentally-relevant programming languages?

However, I think I‚Äôve decided that it isn‚Äôt worth it, and I would prefer to do something I‚Äôm passionate about. 

I would love to work in wildlife conservation or in a field that positively impacts wildlife in some way. My university offers the degree mentioned above as well as one that is just a bachelor of science in sustainability. The biology-focused degree seems more in-depth with more course options in ecology specifically, so I would likely choose that one. 

I want to attempt to go on to get my Ph.D. or my masters at the very least. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for input on the degree itself and validation that this would be a positive choice.

During the first summer of my masters I got my current job in local government (a towns conservation department) mainly working in the same kinds of systems I did my research in (coastal and estuarine ecosystems).  Now I feel somewhat lost.  I‚Äôm finding I don‚Äôt quite enjoy my job and I don‚Äôt know why.  I‚Äôve thought a lot about it and I think it mostly comes down to the environment and my supervisor.  The environment being local government I feel I just don‚Äôt get along with many of the people here and it causes me a good deal of stress.  My supervisor I feel tends to treat his employees as if were grad students, giving us projects to do and not really checking in unless we need help.  I enjoy the problem solving nature of it but I don‚Äôt enjoy feeling lost because I can‚Äôt reach out to him for help.  

I‚Äôve been thinking about going back for a PhD, but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôd be just as stressed out and I‚Äôm not sure if I can avoid the classic work/life balance issues.  On the other hand I felt most confident in myself while doing my masters research.

I‚Äôve looked for other jobs and particularly trying other environments but for all I know any job I get could be the same.

I should also mention I work part time at my current job and due to bureaucratic nonsense getting full time will be difficult.

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is should I just suck it up, find a different career, shift my perspective or keep looking got new opportunities.",1619628843

84,ecology,Considering career change to ecology/conservation/environmental data analysis,"I'm 27 and I have a relatively mundane (but stable) office job in the UK working at a basic level with data and excel. I've never really known what I want to do for a career but enjoy working with more complex problems and data analysis than is required in this job and one of my few passions is wildlife from growing up in the country.

I've looked into potential careers based around those two things and most seem to ask for degrees etc. that I don't have, as I skipped university and went straight into work (which also means I have much less understanding of university level work and qualifications in general). 

Is it realistic to make that change through distance learning, online courses etc. while still working full time? Where would be a good place to start and what kind of route would be advised to take?",1619625353

90,ecology,Should I still try to publish my undergrad thesis research?,"So, I completed a thesis project back in 2020. 

I had 3 advisors for the project, one of which said I should try to publish and it wouldn‚Äôt be too much more work. However one of my other advisors was hesitant as, I think she wanted to check with other collaborators of the larger project that we were working within (something like that, I‚Äôm still not entirely sure what the hesitancy was about but suffice it to say my research was a little part using data from a large project with many collaborators, and I basically carried this out on my own without contact with many of them, especially since COVID prevented travel to our field sites and prevented me from collecting any of my own field data. My project brought together my own remote sensing analysis with their field data, so it wasn‚Äôt *only* built off of their data, but might have overlapped with other work on the same area somewhat). 

Anyway, due to those complications and me getting busy figuring out what I was to be doing post-graduation, I let the thought of publication slide and didn‚Äôt follow up. 

Now, I‚Äôm wondering if I should try again even though I‚Äôve now left the institution and moved on. The issue currently would be that the field season is beginning soon, and all my advisors will become busy with their own work. And even outside of the field season these are busy people as well. 

Still, I am trying to figure out whether it would be best to contact them and solicit advice for trying to get this published maybe over this next year as their own timeframes allow. This would be my first publication and so I don‚Äôt really know how the process works yet. Which means Id have to rely on their guidance in reviewing and how to approach sending the manuscript to journals, etc. 

I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs best to reach out and pitch this, or just move on and keep this as an unpublished thesis project I can point to. I plan to go to grad school afterwards, and my upcoming gig is sort of an internship that allows an independent research project with the possibility to publish. So I think I can make up for this in the future and have other research publications. 

I just thought I‚Äôd ask people who know a bit more about all this than me what might be the right course of action here.",1619552292

I just landed my first temporary field work gig monitoring a shorebird population (and potentially other waterfowl). I‚Äôm so excited but terribly anxious. I have a meeting later about some of the logistics, but I only have three weeks to prepare for a 3-month humid/hot summer term. I hike a fair amount but not in the type of environment I will be working. 

Does anyone have experience with field work primarily on sandy shores that have to be accessed by boat? I was wondering about the following:

- Best shoes specifically for this kind of transitional environment? I searched some tags on here and couldn‚Äôt find any other posts. 

- Women‚Äôs breathable pants that aren‚Äôt lower rise (and underwear recs)

- What is the expectation for meals? It will just be me and one other tech after the first couple of weeks, housing provided. Does housing typically include, like, a skillet? Do folks typically cook together or keep their meals partitioned? What are some cheap, easy vegetarian meals you rely on? (Pay is average for this position, so very low) 

- I‚Äôll be working around 4 hours away from my home (and partner, and dog). My supervisor mentioned that the other tech and I would be making our schedules, so if we needed to work different days one week that would be fine if we both agreed. That made it sound like there will be days off (which I wasn‚Äôt actually expecting). Would it be out of line to ask about a few ‚Äúweekend‚Äù trips home? This would be leaving the other person alone. Will that make me look bad?

- Any tips on small kindnesses for others in the field? What‚Äôs something that someone had/did for you that lifted spirits during long days?

Abstract: Eutrophication, i.e. nutrient over-enrichment, has been a topic for academic and societal debate for the past five decades both on land and in aquatic systems fed by nutrients as diffuse loading from agricultural lands and as wastewater from industrial and municipal point-sources. The use of nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) in excess became a problem with the onset of large-scale production and use of artificial fertilizers after World War II, and the effects on the aquatic environment became obvious some two to three decades later. In this Perspective, four seminal papers on eutrophication are discussed in light of the current knowledge of the problem, including future perspectives and outlooks in the light of global climate change and the demand for science-based holistic ecosystem-level policies and management options.",1619407325

And because it's surrounded by woodland some young trees have colonised the bog. The Cheshire Wildflife Trust says this about it, 'An example of early ‚Äòschwingmoor‚Äô or floating bog development, over half of the pool is covered by a delicate sphagnum ‚Äòraft‚Äô.¬† On the outer most regions of the raft, associated bog flora is dominant above the carpet of sphagnum, with scattered saplings and young trees found throughout.¬† These invasive trees become waterlogged as they increase in weight, when they eventually fall through the sphagnum raft and die.¬† This natural process helps prevent the bog from becoming woodland.'
(https://www.cheshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/black-lake)

These people have a pro-'wildlife', anti-wildness agenda so I'm not just taking their word for it. Are bog woodlands ultimately impossible on quaking bogs? Can it just not hold their weight, compared to a raised bog which is maybe more solid?

Abstract:

Climate changes are predicted to influence gross primary production (GPP) of lakes directly through warming and indirectly through increased loads of allochthonous coloured dissolved organic matter (cDOM) from surrounding landscapes. However, few studies have investigated this combined effect.

Here we tested the effects of warming (elevated 3‚ÑÉ) and cDOM input (three levels of humic river water addition) on GPP in autumn (2 months including open water and ice‚Äêcovered periods) in experimental pond ecosystems.

The cDOM input decreased whole‚Äêecosystem GPP at natural temperature conditions mainly as a result of lower benthic GPP not fully counteracted by an increase in pelagic GPP, while warming increased whole‚Äêecosystem GPP due to a positive response of mainly pelagic GPP at all levels of cDOM input.

Warming delayed autumn ice cover formation by 2 weeks but did not affect light availability in the water column compared to ambient ice‚Äêcovered treatments. Gross primary production during this period was still affected by warming and cDOM.

The results stress the importance of accounting for multiple climate drivers and habitats when predicting lake GPP responses to climate change. We conclude that climate change may shift whole‚Äêecosystem GPP through different responses of habitat‚Äêspecific GPP to increasing cDOM inputs and warming.",1618802664

70,ecology,Studying geomatics and interested in movement ecology.,"So, I am studying geomatics in Germany right now(masters) and it's a very diverse program. We learn things like remote sensing, GIS, coding etc. Now my study program allows us to base our thesis on very diverse subjects from pure IT to ecology. I did an internship in studying movement ecology of red deer in Germany and realised that I am really interested in this and would like to make career out of this. I have good R skills and basically want to go for modelling jobs. However, as a foreigner here I have very limited time to look for a job once my degree is done and I definitely don't want to go back to my country. I want to be as safe as possible and get a good job here.   
So my question is, do you think the career path I want to go for will land me a good job? Or should I keep working towards my skills in remote sensing and GIS and once I am more stable try to change my career path towards this?  
PS. I speak B2 German right now and will probably be C1 by the time I finish my degree.",1618566108

Trying to pivot from an adjacent career into ecology.  I applied for a graduate program and chose my professor based on our shared interests.  One issue is that he doesn't run a research lab, while many of the other faculty members do.  He is advising several students, but they are all doing independent work, and in general his attitude feels a little low-key for my taste. I feel like it's important to be apart of a research team in order to really gain momentum as an outsider, in terms of publishing opportunities, exposure to methods, etc.

I'm searching for ideas to redesign my home in order to passively save electricity but I don't know any technical words to search for on the internet so I figured some people here might know what I'm looking for or might have an idea to share \^\^

Basically the observation is: 

1. I try adding a new habit (like switching off multisockets before going to bed ‚ñ∫ avoid ""sleep mode"" for all those machines that I don't use during the night!)
2. It lasts a few days/weeks
3. I end up forgetting all about that.

I figured it may just be because it's not efficient: I've got about 10 multi-sockets to turn off and it's just so tedious to do day after day! But if I had some kind of a centralised equipment that would turn off all of them in one click...

So, do you know of stuff that would help doing that without having to change the whole power-grid of the house?? \^\^

I‚Äôm an undergrad student, and I‚Äôm interested in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, I also do see myself doing a great deal of lab work. 

I guess my question is, which is a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù route:
1. A masters in ecology/evolution where I pick genetic subjects, if available. (And perhaps later get more lab experience under my belt). However, will I get the lab work I want, in an ecology/evolution masters program?
2. A masters degree in cell biology (or related), to acquire the lab skills required, and then move on to do ecology (PhD, perhaps). 

It would be great if people who have a career or are doing research in my areas of interest, tell me how they got there and what path they took? I‚Äôm super confused and I‚Äôm not sure where to go for help about this. Just your general education trajectory would help, immensely!!

I unfortunately live in a country where ecology is not very well known, so I‚Äôm being told that doing molecular/cell biology is ‚Äúsafer‚Äù, career wise, and once I do that, I can go on to specialize in something ecology related. While that may be true in my country, I know that definitely isn‚Äôt the case, overall.

Being the research/worldbuilding pedant that I am, I really want to ensure I get my environment descriptions right. I'm already working with two fantastic scientists, a zoologist and a geologist, who are helping me to flesh out the fauna and the geology of the underground lake the oasis was built from, but I feel like I'm poking around in the dark when it comes to flora. I read a couple of books on deserts and tried to search my way around the internet, but I'm having trouble finding a good resource to read up on what types of plants and trees (besides date palms) would grow in such an oasis. I find it highly immersive for the narration to be specific, albeit concise, when describing environments. :)

&gt;**Smoking affects those who smoke, those who are close to the smoker, and those who produce and grow tobacco. Explain the risks of smoking and how the cultivation of tobacco affects both those who grow tobacco and the environment**

&gt;  
&gt;In Sweden today, it is more common to use snus than cigarettes. Between the period 2006‚Äì2020, there was a decrease in the proportion of people between the ages of 16‚Äì84 who smoked tobacco daily. In 2020, it was found that a small percentage of the population between the ages of 16‚Äì84 smoked tobacco daily, with an equal proportion between women and men. Tobacco smoking can lead to serious diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, various lung diseases, and type-2 diabetes. Cigarettes contain thousands of harmful substances, of which a few dozen are substances that can cause cancer. A common disease associated with smoking is COPD, which is an abbreviation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the development of the disease can be slowed down by quitting smoking. The effect of tobacco smoke not only affects the person who pulls the flare away from the cigarette, but also those who are in the environment of the smoker can also be affected in the same way. Here you talk about passive smoking, and you can also get COPD here if you are close to cigarette smoke, because you are exposed to the substances that the smoker also does, but of course it depends on how often you are around smokers. For example, someone with allergies and / or asthma may be affected by secondhand smoke. Then there is also a toxic substance such as nicotine in tobacco, which is harmful to consumers and leads to addiction, but also for those who work in production where you often work without protective equipment due to poverty. This leads to the absorption of nicotine through the skin, which is then absorbed into the blood, where work for a whole day can correspond to up to 50 cigarettes, and lead to nicotine poisoning. (Henriksson 2016; Public Health Agency 2021).  
&gt;  
&gt;The Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates that children shall not be discriminated against, inter alia, and that they have the right to achieve good health. This convention was ratified by many of the world's countries, including Sweden in 1990. However, many countries are unable to implement this convention due to e.g. a weak economy, or legislation, among other factors that are societal. This has led to child labor in tobacco production in countries such as Malawi, which is dependent on tobacco exports, and Indonesia. From an ecological perspective, it is also the case that cultivation requires toxic pesticides that, among other things, cause poisoning of watercourses and fish deaths, but fertilizers are also needed as tobacco plants empty the soil of nutrients and deplete the soil, which leads to new land to grow tobacco. on, which in turn leads to more deforestation. For the UN's global sustainability goals by the year 2030, tobacco is an obstacle for the world to achieve the sustainability goal. The tobacco industry emits more than 84 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents annually (Nonsmoking et al.; Tobacco facts et al.).  
&gt;  
&gt;In Sweden, smoking costs society several billion kronor every year, which is why you want a smoke-free Sweden by the year 2025. It is therefore a responsibility on society to inform about the various consequences that come with smoking. For example, you can save several thousand lives, and how to realize a smoke-free Sweden is by initiating smoke-free environments on a larger scale, and introducing e.g. exposure bans, invest in preventive measures to improve health, and invest in disseminating knowledge on how to prevent ill health through healthy lifestyles. By reducing smoking, society can save a lot of money as well, as healthcare is state-funded",1617678620

12,ecology,How Would I approach/communicate with two State (and NGO) biologists (who I have been speaking for several months) regarding Prospective work/research,"Hello,
 
I am cross posting to R/Ecology as well as I would like insight from this community if possible. Anyways, I graduated with my PhD last year and due to the pandemic, I have been stuck in ""adjunct hell"". As such, I have been actively seeking employment working in spatial ecology/the environmental sciences (private or public sectors). My background is specifically in spatial ecology, including determining/informing mitigation efforts involving connectivity based off of animal habitat selection.

Since November, I have been speaking with one of the directors from a local chapter of a well known NGO. He read my PhD thesis and we have been chatting on and off about prospective work, and using my skill sets, to improve mitigation efforts.

Two weeks ago, I met up with this individual as well as a state biologist regarding these things. I prepared extensively, and even provided some methods for prospective analyses that go with their aims and goals that are also cost effective (in short, I have been doing my research!).

During that conversation, I did somewhat bring up that I am seeking employment....and then they told me that (sic) ""you would undoubtedly be our go to person given your expertise, however, we are currently broke and are waiting for funding. We will let you know when that information comes in"".

Right, I was a bit disappointed..especially because the conversations leading up to this past discussion seemed like they were trying to employ me (at least that is how I perceived it).

Following, I sent a follow up email just saying thank you, etc. and in response...one of the state scientists essentially says (once again, this isn't word for word):

"" another thought when it comes to your skill sets is to accomplish x, y, and z. It would be great to talk with you again soon about the best methods we can use to improve these things as well if able. I wish we were able to pay you but hopefully we will have some funding in the future. I would also like to publish, so that may be of interest to you as well. Just to know from past experience that it often takes a partner to take the lead and make things happen!""

Look, I absolutely adore the work they are doing and it is of great interest to me. Also, the individuals who I have been chatting with are all lovely people. However, I am really unsure how to answer this email or what they are looking for. Are they looking for me to just volunteer? I know that is a key component and starting point to NGOs but at 33, and having to pay rent...I really cannot afford to do that.

In addition, I did actively seek out methods (and I am pretty sure I know a few great solutions) to prepare for that meeting, and research does take time. Given this, I am a bit unsure on how to answer. Are they asking me to volunteer or compensate me with publications? Are they speaking about prospective goals (so, when and if I get hired?). I am unsure. As mentioned earlier, I would love to work with them, but I really do not have the time nor ability to volunteer and provide research methods without some kind of financial compensation.

Given all of this,for those of you in this sub, have you ever encountered this type of conversation? How would you approach/interpret it?

14,ecology,How to Overcome Entry Level Job Frustration??,"Just taking a moment to rant a little. Hoping for some advice or words of wisdom...

I'm 26, graduated from a ""top 20"" school for undergrad in biology, with an area emphasis in ecology. 

Since I graduated about \~4 years ago, I've worked for several different lab groups at my alma mater as a laboratory assistant, field technician, etc. Mostly just doing fulltime ""grunt"" work in the lab, on computer (GIS), or in the field. Areas of research of the different lab's ive been in are: freshwater ecology, ecosystem services &amp; land-use change, landscape genetics, and hydrogeology. Not really doing my own research, just helping grad students/post docs/PI's finish their own research lines.

I've also worked full time as an associate level scientist for the microbiology department of a QAQC food safety lab for a year inbetween positions at the university. In total, I have about \~2 years of field work experience, \~2 years of wet lab experience. Great GPA. I've worked other jobs outside of STEM (service industry, national parks service, hospitality+catering gigs) to support myself as a student. 

Basically, the NSF grant of my previous lab group has run out, and I have been unemployed for the last 3 months and been totally unable to even get a callback from \*any\* jobs related to environmental science/ecology. What's even more frustrating is the amount of jobs that are offering to pay hardly above minimum wage, and/or require 2-4+ years of experience in highly specific consulting fields as an entry level position.  Pretty much every job I have applied to is earning *less* than what I have been earning in all of my jobs that I've had since graduating, and I still can't even get a callback/interview. Not to mention, how am I supposed to be qualified with several years of experience in a specialized area of biological monitoring/habitat restoration/invasive species identification and removal if it's an entry level position? 

I was offered a job doing entry level biological monitoring in streams with a state water resource agency, but they were offering me 13/hr when the minimum wage where I live is about 16/hr... for a position requiring 1 year field work experience and a bachelors degree...So I had to turn them down (state agencies are exempt from local minimum wage laws) since I can't feasibly support myself where I live making 13/hr fulltime.

I knew working in environmental fields wasn't going to earn me much money but..damn..I can't even get a job to begin with. Not to mention the fact that they're paying pretty much poverty wages for the COL where I'm at. 

Feeling like I should just move onto a different field, go back to doing more molecular bio/microbiology stuff, even though that's not where my heart/passion is at all. It's just frustrating to see that I could be making more per hour working at a cafe or something than any of the entry level jobs in environmental science/ecology.

Maybe my expectations are too high? I just don't know where to go from here. I tried applying to grad school, but I haven't gotten accepted anywhere this cycle for an MS.

&gt;**Theory**  
&gt;  
&gt;Just like humans, plants need energy and nutrition to be able to grow. Plants form energy-rich nutrients such as glucose with non-organic substances such as carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide adds carbon atoms to the carbon skeleton of glucose molecules. In addition to carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose, the plant also needs energy sources like sunlight. The sun‚Äôs light energy is collected in a green pigment called chlorophyll which is found inside plant cells. The plants can then use this light energy through photosynthesis to form, among other things, oxygen and the energy-rich organic substance glucose, which is important for living organisms. Humans inhale the oxygen that plants emit to their environment, but glucose is also used for consumption. Photosynthesis has the following reaction formula (Henriksson 2016):  
&gt;  
&gt;Light energy + carbon dioxide + water ‚Üí glucose + oxygen  
&gt;  
&gt;Humans and other living organisms consume plants for the glucose and nutrients provided. Fungi and bacteria also need this energy-rich nutrition produced from photosynthesis. Plants' cells use glucose as fuel when it is dark, and the glucose can also be transported to the cells in the roots, because sugars are needed to support new tissue growth.In addition to photosynthesis, plants also undergo cellular respiration, and are therefore dependent on oxygen. During cellular respiration, glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water, which are then used in photosynthesis. Thus, you have a perpetuating cycle. During cellular respiration, the light energy that drove photosynthesis releases energy, which is then ultimately converted into heat that the plants radiate, and overtime is radiated further into space. Because energy is lost through heat, energy is not reused in the cycle, which is why life on Earth is based on light energy from the sun (ibid.; Ehinger 2020).  
&gt;  
&gt;Plants such as garlic have a root system that absorb water and nutrients from the substrate, store carbohydrates and nutrients, and anchor the plant in the soil. A root consists of a main root and side roots; the main root can be a pile root that sinks straight through the ground, while fibrous side roots are spread evenly in the ground. A vegetable like a carrot may have a taproot, while garlic has fibrous side roots. Roots on vegetables have shoots that are formed by some cells in the outermost layer of the root, the epidermis, and are evenly distributed. These facilitate the uptake of water by increasing the areas of the roots (Ehinger 2020).  
&gt;  
&gt;Nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, can increase vegetation in an ecosystem, but there can also be restrictions when there are deficiencies in nutrients needed for plants. In lakes, for example, there is often a shortage of phosphorus, while in clean seas and forests, there is competition for nitrogen among the plants. Environmental problems can arise with eutrophication, as seas and lakes are affected by fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus. This takes place in agriculture when leakage of the fertilizer takes place in ditches and streams before they enter the lake and sea. Air pollutants such as car exhaust also contribute to overfertilization because it contains nitrogen oxides, which contain a large amount of nitrogen. Wastewater, households, and factories and manufacturers, also release nutrients, but before this reaches the sea and sea, this treatment plant passes, but not all treatment plants are equally effective in purifying nitrogen-containing nutrients or phosphorus. Forestry also adds to eutrophication in the lakes and seas, because nutrients are released during deforestation, and roots and branches are broken down. Tree roots that are alive do not absorb water and nutrients that are found from the ground; instead, water flows through the soil layer that exists, and with it, it takes the nutrients to the sea, lake, or waterway. When there is eutrophication, there is increased vegetation; as plant production increases, more dead algae and plant parts end up on the bottom. What this means is that decomposers and bacteria multiply at the bottom of the oceans, and when they have multiplied, they also consume more oxygen when they breathe. This leads to the depletion of oxygen in lakes and oceans that ingest a lot of nutrients, and living organisms such as fish die, like cods in the Baltic Sea. (Henriksson 2016; Swedish Environmental Protection Agency 2021).  
&gt;  
&gt;Detergents should, as a rule, be easily biodegradable in accordance with the regulations that exist for detergents and detergents. For example, the detergent decree states that these regulations exist to reduce environmental risks with detergents and improve the information that is reached to consumers. There must be a declaration on the table of contents for the packaging of these cleaning products. It is stipulated in appendix VII of the decree that if the detergent has a content of a substance in a content above 0.2%, it is necessary to be mentioned. These substances can be anything from surfactants, to oxygen-based or chlorine-based bleaches, to soap. Although not toxic in any other way, surfactants can be irritating to the mucous membranes; they can cause burning in the throat and mouth, as well as vomiting and nausea when swallowed. Descaling agents can also be irritating and corrosive, and these agents include acids such as citric acid and phosphoric acid. However, there are eco-labeled products that are not as dangerous to the environment as others. According to the rules in the Detergent Ordinance, products that are detergents need to be labeled, which helps consumers to shop in an environmentally-friendly way; for example, the swan and the EU flower can label products that meet strict environmental requirements, and can be found in various areas of use, including detergents for companies (Kemikalieinspektionen 2021; Poison Information Center 2018).  
&gt;  
&gt;Fertilizers can provide the macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to plants such as garlic, and act as an extra supplement. Nitrogen causes the plant to synthesize chlorophyll; chlorophyll prevents a plant from turning pale and yellowing, and nitrogen prevents the leaves from withering and the plant from becoming loose and being exposed to pests. Phosphorus also plays a role in the plant; for example, the substance is found in various cell membranes, in addition to being a component of nucleic acids as well as carrying genetic information. There are also phosphorus compounds that play an important role in the transport and storage of energy that a plant assimilates during photosynthesis. Potassium also helps regulate a plant's pH, regulate water pressure, and prevent frost, among other things, and also plays a role in protein synthesis and starch synthesis (Jordbruksverket 2003).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Discussion**  
&gt;  
&gt;My hypothesis was correct. The garlic cloves immersed in the aqueous solution with detergent did not have as much growth in their roots as the other garlic cloves immersed in water only and the aqueous solution containing fertilizer, respectively. Furthermore, this experiment showed that 2.0mL of fertilizer affects how much the roots grow, relative to the other garlic cloves that grew more markedly and were immersed in 1.0mL and 0.5mL of fertilizer. This experiment shows that fertilizers at volumes higher than 1.0mL and cleaning agents between 0.5mL and 2.0mL reduce the overall growth of the roots of a clove of garlic. Also, the garlic clove's roots that were soaked in an aqueous solution with 0.5mL of detergent had a similar growth as the ones soaked in an aqueous solution with 2.0mL of fertilizer. Most remarkable is how more than 0.5mL of detergent led to the stem growing barely 1.0 cm, and the roots not growing at all. As I explained before, fertilizers do contribute to plants such as garlic, receiving an addition of essential substances such as phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen to their growth, but with a larger amount of fertilizer, it affects water uptake.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some sources of error from this experiment are that it has taken place during the cold winters of November, and thus there may not have been enough sunlight to supply the garlic cloves with energy for photosynthesis. Other sources of error are that I may not have measured all the liquids accurately when I poured them into the spice jars. Cleaning agents does not help the plants on any level; it kills what is good in the water and leaves poison for the plant.",1617581335

So today I went for a walk on a quite mismanaged and tortured patch of what used to be forest near my house, to see the situation and how much has it changed. At one point I noticed a water course that ran into a nearby stream. The water course looks incredible bad. Its orange like rust, and it has some kind of gooey orange sediment that falls into the stream, turning it completely orange.

I rally dont know what it is or if it is dangerous, so I come here for answers. Is it some kind of contaminant? What is its cause? Should I be worried about it?

Here are some pictures of it.

Thanks in advance!

I am currently finishing a double bachelor degree in Anthropology and Art History in my home country in Europe. Anthropology's wide scope and holistic approach is something that suits me really well and is the reason why I got into ecology in the first place. What interests me is learning more about biosphere, its functioning and the way humans interact with it, as well as conservation of living and non-living matter. I am inclined towards the idea that a lot od technology and commodities that we accumulated are not really making our lives better, but are only making Earth suffer and I am aware of multifaceted spectrum of factors that are responsible for that, so I would like, not only, to focus on solving ecological problems, but also on, general relationship between humans themselves and nature, because I believe the climate crisis can not be solved just by itself. (I am aware that is not a small task by any means but it is a direction I want to go towards.)

In a nutshell, I would like to help in making a change in the way world functions and I feel like some kind of education in that direction would be help me get closer to that goal.  I am kind of lost and do not know what to do or where to look so I hope this post is not too vague or asking too much. Some kind of specific recommendation for a study or something I can look into, as well as any kind of opinion or suggestion is more than welcome. &lt;3",1617384539

43,ecology,Unique macro-vertebrate at risk from blood sport and climate change,"*Kangaskhan (Garura kangaskhani) are two-meter-tall Pokemon, endemic to Australia. Although commonly spotted around cities and other urban areas, information is lacking about their basic biology and wider range distribution. Much of what is known is based on anecdotes from the public, especially unlicensed breeders, many of whom are not trained in scientific research. Today, kangaskhan are believed to be threatened due to frequent poaching of adults and eggs. The poaching is primarily motivated by the demand for these animals to be used in fighting contests. This pressure, combined with the fact that climate change is predicted to have a large impact in Australia over the next few decades, has resulted in a bleak outlook for this majestic Pokemon species.*  


*Now, researchers in the Biodiversity and Biocomplexity Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) have taken an extensive look at how climate change will impact the existence of suitable habitat for kangaskhan. This study was published today in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.*  


*""Apart from seeming to prefer partly cloudy weather, very little is known about the species' climatic preferences,"" said lead author Dr. Dan Warren, who previously worked as a researcher in Australia. ""This makes it difficult to estimate the response of kangaskhan to environmental change, or how climate change might combine with the effects of poaching to impact the species' long-term survival. For this research, we used several well-known modeling methods to gain insight into how threatened kangaskhan really are.""*  


*Aside from revealing uncertainty surrounding the long-term survival of kangaskhan, the research has also shed light on how scientists can calculate the biases that come with species distribution models. ""We found that we could determine the level of bias with a simple statistical test,"" said Dr. Warren. ""And, in doing so, we realized that some of these models could be so biased that the data didn't have much effect on their results... effectively the conclusion was picked based on study design regardless of what the data actually showed,"" said Dr. Warren.*  


*""It's a bit silly but it's also cool science,"" said Dr. Warren. ""Stakeholders use these models for predicting a number of important ecological phenomena, from the effects of climate change, to the dispersal of diseases and invasive species, so having a firm understanding of the biases the models might have is important. We've just scratched the surface of what we can do with this method so I think this could be a useful tool for a whole bunch of things.""*",1617262728

I'm hoping to relocate anywhere in the states for the summer, so location isn't really an issue--is it appropriate to just email the environmental studies departments of colleges in cities/locations I'm interested in? Are there any websites that would give me a more refined job hunt than indeed? Is there a subreddit that gives advice on this kind of thing?

We are a science outreach endeavor on Twitch.tv called [Ask_a_Scientist_Gaming](https://www.twitch.tv/ask_a_scientist_gaming/about). Wednesday night, 8-11 pm EDT, our guest will be oceanographer Dr. Angela Knapp. Her research focuses on understanding how nitrogen-based nutrients impact phytoplankton growth in the ocean which plays a pivotal role in regulating atmospheric CO2. They collect and analyze samples from around the ocean including from the phytoplankton bloom after lava from the 2018 Kilauea eruption hit the ocean, where the Mississippi River mixes with deep Gulf of Mexico waters, and over the Tonga subduction zone. Come hear Angie talk about her experiences sailing the ocean and their work to understand the larges ecosystems on earth.

I did an experiment where I submerged garlic root in water, and water solutions containing detergent, as well as water solution containing fertilizer. I have to write a ‚Äùtheory‚Äù that serves as a foundation for my experiment.

Would any of you agree that my experiment is on membrane permeability? I think I've to look into the causes and effects of membrane permeability. I believe the fertilizer is so that one can measure transport of molecules between the root and the water, and the detergent should change how permeable the root cells are to the molecules of fertilizer.

I could probably also talk about the impacts of toxins on plant growth, but I don't think great depth is necessary, right? As the experiment itself was not about toxins. The influence of substances which alter cell permeability is most important, as that will apply to both fertilizer and toxins.

I strive to get a grade A on this assignment, and for that, my teacher told me that I have to meet these criteria:

*Answer in detail (write detailed explanations of processes and show that you also understand the overall picture) but also nuanced, i.e. write detailed, compare, reflect, use a correct language (terminology), generalize, find examples that do not come directly from the book, etc. You must also be able to limit yourself, write in a structured, rigorous, and concise manner.*

Some of my references just notified me that they were contacted and were told that my interviewers were impressed with me so I'm fairly confident I will be offered the job. Right now, all staff is working remotely and have been since March of last year. During the first interview, I asked if this was a permanent move to remote work, if all staff is expected to work in office full-time in the future, basically what the deal was, as I'm based out of the east coast (US), and the job is based out of the west coast. They told me there have been some vague talks about returning to the office maybe in June but that nothing has been confirmed as of yet. In the second interview, I also touched on this, and they said they can't see a future admin working fully remote as an option once people start returning to the office but again clarified that there are now definite plans to return as of yet. But they're aware of my stance of staying on the east coast and are choosing to pursue me so I'm a bit confused.

How would you approach this if you were offered the job? How would you try to convince/ask them to consider remote work for you, with monthly/bi-monthly travel to the office? I need help wording and navigating this. What proof can I provide them that will help assure them of my productivity considering I haven't worked with this company before?

&gt;Smoking affects those who smoke, as well as those who are close to the smoker and those who produce and grow tobacco. Explain the risks of smoking and how the cultivation of tobacco affects those who grow tobacco and the environment. In your answer, explain how the human body is affected, and reason about how sustainable the cultivation of tobacco is (ecologically, socially and economically sustainable). Note, your answer should be a maximum of 1 A4 page.

My answer:

&gt;Tobacco affects not only human health but also the environment and living conditions of those who grow tobacco.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Cultivation of tobacco requires massive amounts of fertilizers and toxins that also contribute to water pollution. In terms of health, it affects those who work on tobacco farms. In addition to this, about 600 million trees are felled annually to prepare land for the plantations. With this comes the loss of biodiversity and encouraging climate change.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Tobacco in all its forms contributes to a lot of the littering in our streets. According to measurements made by Keep Sweden Clean, about 80 percent of the garbage in Swedish cities is tobacco-related. Also, the cigarette's filter contains a type of plastic called Cellulose Acetate; the breakdown of this in nature takes a very long time, and both animals and nature are damaged.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Smoking has significant effects on the human body too. The neurotoxin nicotine is extremely toxic, even a very small dose (0.05g) is enough to kill an adult. When smoked, each puff contains about 8,000 different chemical compounds, including carbon monoxide, which is harmful to the blood vessels and the heart. Hydrogen cyanide, tar, arsenic, and various carcinogens are also found in cigarette smoke. These small particles easily stick to the airways' cilia and increase mucus formation. Additionally, many of these harmful substances get stuck in the smoker's lungs, which leads to a sharp deterioration of oxygen uptake and lung capacity. The risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer thus increases.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
A smoker takes many risks regarding their health and lifestyle and exposes their body's defenses to degradation. The risk of tooth loss, osteoporosis (increases the size of small spaces inside bones, causing them to lose strength and density), age blindness are just some of the dangers. Also, it should be mentioned that 9 out of 10 cases that suffer from severe vasoconstriction in the legs are or have been smokers.  
The smoking-related costs for loss of production and care in Sweden lead to a cost of around SEK 31 billion per year, while the tobacco tax collects just under SEK 12 billion per year. The WHO recommends that the excise tax on tobacco be at least 70 percent of the cigarette price. According to studies, it can be shown that higher tobacco taxes, which increase the price of cigarettes by ten percent, lead to a reduction between 3-5% of consumption in high-income countries. Thus, it can be said that this measure is preferable. With higher taxation, tobacco habits and their subsequent consequences may decrease gradually until the next generation.",1617032690

Abstract: Wetland ecosystems perform a multitude of services valued by society and provide critical habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. Despite their importance, wetlands have been lost to different local, regional, and global drivers. Remaining wetlands are extremely sensitive to changing temperature and precipitation regimes. Management of grassland areas in wetland catchments may be an effective strategy for counteracting potentially negative impacts of climate change on wetlands. Our objective was to estimate the effects of climate changes on wetland hydrology, and to explore strategies for increasing surface-water inputs to wetlands. We coupled a field study with process-based simulation modeling of wetland-water levels. We found that climate change could decrease the number of wetlands that hold ponded water during the waterfowl breeding season by 14% under a hot wet scenario or 29% under a hot dry scenario if no upland-management actions were taken. Upland burning reduced pond losses to 9% (hot wet) and 26% (hot dry). Upland grazing resulted in the smallest loss of ponded wetlands, 6% loss under the hot-and-wet scenario and 22% loss under the hot-and-dry scenario. Overall, water inputs could be increased by either burning or grazing of upland vegetation thereby reducing pond losses during the waterfowl breeding season. While field results suggest that both grazing and burning can reduce the vegetative structure that could lead to increases in runoff in grassland catchments, our model simulations indicated that additional actions may be needed for managers to minimize future meteorologically driven water losses.",1616987428

Abstract: 

1. Riparian forests are commonly advocated as a key management option to mitigate the effects of agriculture on headwater stream biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, the benefits of riparian forests might be reduced by uninterrupted catchment‚Äêscale pollution.

2. We studied the effects of riparian land use on multiple ecological endpoints in headwater streams in an agricultural landscape. We studied stream habitat characteristics, water temperature and algal accrual, and macrophyte, benthic macroinvertebrate and fish communities in 11 paired forested and open agricultural headwater stream reaches that differed in their extent of riparian forest cover but had similar water quality.
    
3. Hydromorphological habitat quality was higher in forested reaches than in open reaches. Riparian forest had a strong effect on the summer water temperature regime, with maximum and mean water temperatures and temperature variation in forested reaches substantially lower than in open reaches.
    
4. Macrophyte communities differed between forested and open reaches. The mean abundance of bryophytes was higher in forested reaches but the difference to open reaches was only marginally significant, whereas graminoids were significantly more abundant in open reaches. Within‚Äêstream dissimilarity of benthic macroinvertebrate community structure was significantly related to the difference in riparian land use between reach pairs. The relative DNA sequence abundance of pollution‚Äêsensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera species tended to be higher in forested reaches than in open reaches. Finally, fish densities were not significantly different between forested and open reaches, although densities were higher in forested reaches.
    
5. This unequivocal evidence for the ecological benefits of forested riparian reaches in agricultural headwater streams suggests that riparian forest can partly mitigate the adverse impacts of agricultural diffuse pollution on biota. The strong effect of forests on stream water temperature suggest that riparian forest could also mitigate harmful effects on headwater stream biodiversity and ecosystem functions of the predicted more frequent high summer temperatures.",1615777419

52,ecology,Questions on the impact of farming fruit-bearing plants for human consumption on soil quality and nutrient availability,"I recently discovered interest in farming, forests, and ecosystems. My knowledge is very limited. I was pondering on the effect of growing fruits for human consumption in great quantities in such a restricted space on the health and richness of a soil. There are a few questions I'd love to have answered, and they seem to be connected to each other:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Fruits which humans prefer to consume seem to be very rich in multiple types of micronutrients (for example tomatoes, pumpkins, apples, bananas). Do wild trees and plants which you would find in a natural conservation area (oaks, willow, ash, pine etc.) consume as much nutrients from the soil as these kinds of plants?
2. What is the difference in soil quality and nutrient availability between an acre of land in a untouched forest and the same land had it been stripped of it's native plants plants and turned into a plantation of a single species (say an apple orchard or a vineyard) where the aim is to produce as many fruits and of bigger size for human consumption, in the short term (1-5 years) and in the long term (20-75 years if we can get there)?
3. What would happen if all of the nutrients in the fruits in the monoculture, instead of being stripped away for human consumption, were recycled into the soil the same way this would happen in the wild (apples falling back down and putting back the nutrients in the soil)? Would the soil quality be affected still?
4. Are there any regenerative types of farming where there is no need to re-nourish the soil with the nutrients that went into the bellies of humans, and everything replenishes and seemingly takes care of itself like in a forest?",1615488287

Abstract: Monitoring marine resource exploitation is a key activity in fisheries science and biodiversity conservation. Since research surveys are time consuming and costly, fishery‚Äêdependent data (i.e., derived directly from fishing vessels) are increasingly credited with a key role in expanding the reach of ocean monitoring. Fishing vessels may be seen as widely ranging data‚Äêcollecting platforms, which could act as a fleet of sentinels for monitoring marine life, in particular exploited stocks. Here, we investigate the possibility of assessing catch composition of single hauls carried out by trawlers by applying DNA metabarcoding to the dense water draining from fishing nets just after the end of hauling operations (hereafter ‚Äúslush‚Äù). We assess the performance of this approach in portraying Œ≤‚Äêdiversity and examining the quantitative relationship between species abundances in the catch and DNA amount in the slush (read counts generated by amplicon sequencing). We demonstrate that the assemblages identified using DNA in the slush satisfactorily mirror those returned by visual inspection of net content (about 71% of species and 86% of families of fish) and detect a strong relationship between read counts and species abundances in the catch. We therefore argue that this approach could be upscaled to serve as a powerful source of information on the structure of demersal assemblages and the impact of fisheries.",1615177636

35,ecology,Help me make the right choice!," I've come seeking wisdom. After considering it for 14 years, I've decided I desperately want to work in wildlife conservation. 

Having decided that, I have been on a non-stop rollercoaster of excitement and discouragement. Excited that it seems possible. Discouraged that it seems unlikely.

The main obstacle is that I just turned 34. I've applied, and been accepted, to a 2 year fisheries and wildlife conservation college course. From there I plan on doing a major in Biology at the accompanying University. All said, I could have my Bachelors in 4 years. 

This would make me just shy of 40 with no experience. 

My question is for anyone out there who went through a similar path. Did you find work in the field? Is it even remotely feasible?

I've read tons of articles talking about going back to school in your 30s or older and how most who do didnt regret the decision and how it changed their lives. I've never read one about going back for biology. Generally what I've seen is people going back for things like engineering, or programming.

My main hobby involves advocating for coexistence between people and urban wildlife, with a strong focus on one particular species. I don't get paid, nor do I expect a salary in the future. I don't have the time, resources, or knowledge to appoint and pay staff or write grant proposals. I read scientific articles on my own for fun. The idea is to commission science writers to create articles with accurate ecological information for the general public, for the media, and for stakeholders like government agencies and Animal Control. I'd pay out of my own pocket. I want to create a hub of knowledge on a website with up-to-date information on everything we know about this particular species. What troubles me is that my educational background isn't in science. I've only taken introductory biology courses in university, a few upper year mammalogy courses, introductory ecology, and several upper year geography courses.

I would need to give up a well-paying tech job to devote four years to this degree.

Abstract: Extreme drought events have negative effects on forest diversity and functioning. At the species level, however, these effects are still unclear, as species vary in their response to drought through specific functional trait combinations. We used long‚Äêterm demographic records of 21,821 trees and extensive databases of traits to understand the responses of 338 tropical dry forests tree species to ENSO2015, the driest event in decades in Northern South America. Functional differences between species were related to the hydraulic safety‚Äêefficiency trade‚Äêoff, but unexpectedly, dominant species were characterised by high investment in leaf and wood tissues regardless of their leaf phenological habit. Despite broad functional trait combinations, tree mortality was more widespread in the functional space than tree growth, where less adapted species showed more negative net biomass balances. Our results suggest that if dry conditions increase in this ecosystem, ecological functionality and biomass gain would be reduced.",1613966594

I know states are huge and so i should probably be looking more for cities, but I think states is a good way to narrow it down a bit.

I was pushed into college without much mentorship or any idea what I really wanted to do with my career. I sort of fell into my state school's range program, years ago. I enjoyed learning about and applying GIS, botany, soil science, managing invasives and contributing to the development of ecological sites. I've done a ton of field work to that end, in addition to a season of wildland fire. I've enjoyed and done well with this aspect of the work, but I've kind of remained a field level technician with it all. 

While a student I wasn't great (I finished the degree but I ended up with a pretty dismal GPA. At the time I was struggling with some mental health issues. Between that and some loans I'm still dealing with, it makes the prospect of grad school kind of unlikely). Over the years I have found that culturally, I am a very poor fit for the role of a rangeland management specialist (I can be kind of a soy boy, to be honest) with the relevant federal agencies and frankly I kind of disagree with how public rangeland is managed. I've continued to do so for seasonal work but have had a hard time accepting long term positions in isolated rural areas because of the effect it has had on my personal/social life. For a few years I got lucky and was able to do work relevant to my my field (short of working directly for a range specialist) while living in a city that appealed to me. 

I'd love to get into a coordinator level role with a non-profit, but have found them few and far between, with steep experience requirements relative to their pay to boot.

Abstract: Information on plant community assembly mechanisms is limited on forest reclamation sites after mining in the Canadian boreal forest. We assessed the change in plant community composition after Year 2 and Year 5 on species-rich forest floor mineral mix (FFMM) and species-poor peat mineral mix (PMM) reclamation soils by examining assembly mechanisms, i.e., seed bank, seed rain, biotic dispersal, vegetative expansion, and competition. Initial plant cover and diversity were greater on FFMM due to non-native species originating from the seed bank, which had 5√ó more seeds in the FFMM. By Year 5, both soil types had approximately 40% cover and 80 species richness due to the addition of wind and biotic-dispersed species and were characterized by a shift towards native species. Native forbs using vegetative reproduction expanded up to 2 m from FFMM into PMM. At Year 5 competition does not seem to have a large role in the structuring of the vegetation community. Overall, multiple factors were involved in structuring plant communities on reclamation sites, but we observed a general convergence between plant communities on different soil types in a relatively short period of time.",1613361910

Are there benefits to either working for places like USFWS or a university, or more on the consulting side for stocking privately owned ponds, mostly regarding job security?

I hear that ecology careers involve moving from place to place and it's something I'm trying to avoid. Is this easier with a fisheries job- I just assumed that since most places have at least some freshwater bodies nearby, it won't be like needing to move across the country to study a very specific region.

20,ecology,Trying to write a fantasy book grounded in realism. Need help in a few areas!,"Good day everyone, I am trying to compose a bit of a story that I am attempting to ground in reality, but I want to make sure that the science behind it is at least plausible. That being said, I would really love your input on a few areas. I am going to describe the concept, and I would like you to suggest how I could make it work more realistically, if it is possible.

1. The story is going to be ""fantasy"" in first glance. The different races will actually be humans who have been specifically bred, through hundreds of years, to fit their environment. Dwarves, elves, orcs and gnomes. 
The idea for the dwarves is that they hold up in tunnels, doing manual labor most of the time, became hardier, but shorter than their counterparts. 
The gnomes were humans stranded on an island, unable or unwilling to leave, and ended up with a nutrient deficient diet for so long, their bodies simply became smaller over time. Like the real life pygmies that were only a few feet tall.
Orcs took to the desert, and were bred to be resilient, large, and mostly herbivorous. Broad teeth, but highly sensitive skin that became hardened keloids after being exposed to the blasting winds and sand. 

2. The specifics for each race that I want to make into their ""lore""

Dwarves- Value their beards because they are actually a micro biome of mites that clean the detritus and debris from the hair. Like lice that somehow use the dirt, stone and dust (and food) that falls into the hair. This acts as something of a filtration system. 

Orcs- They live in a relationship with bees that they keep. The bees are mostly passive, and do not sting much, but create copious amounts of honey, that the orcs use to supplement their diet. The orcs are green due to the ""cracks"" between their scars, which collect water and in which moss forms. The bees land on the moss, use the water to remain hydrated when the person is out in the desert, and then, obviously, they do their bee business when the people are out. The people become kind of like roaming hives.

Is that at all even in the realm of possibility? 

Also, if humans were to mostly disappear from the planet for a few centuries, how fast would nature reclaim things? How quickly would forests grow again?

My high school was a STEM school so engineering was heavily encouraged. I enrolled in an engineering school as an environmental engineering thinking I‚Äôd work with plants and nature, realized what they actually meant was waste management in construction, dealing with runoff etc. I accepted that I was basically becoming a civil engineer but two months into the semester I switched to architecture. The culture of studio enticed me and the abstract thinking as well as the hands on nature of the major. 

After two years of school I interned at an architecture firm and absolutely hated it. I continued school again in the fall and in the spring went to do research at an organization for Architecture, Science, and Ecology. I got to work with raw materials. We were specifically researching hemp as a building material. I loved that. The next summer I interned at a engineering consultancy where I was on a commercial roof for most of the summer investigating water damage and other various issues in their renovation. I loved that and loved being the field, taking detailed and specific notes, documenting, and solving problems.

33,ecology,Battlefield ASEAN,"I am Cambodian first-year student studying Environmental engineering at the Institute of Technology. I've moved to a separate article the data on foreign countries' activities on the Cambodian territory, while collecting materials for my educational project.

Thus, it was revealed that the US Administration has been promoting a range of projects on information exchange in the area of environmental and food security with countries of South East Asia. Their interests often collide with similar Chinese ambitions here. It is no surprise that not least in their co-operation with the local partners is propaganda and imposition of anti-Chinese sentiment.

The Mekong River has become a particular stumbling block. This is the longest river in South East Asia. It is in a list of the largest rivers in the world. Mekong has its source on Tibetan Plateau in China and runs through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia before splintering into nine branches of Delta in Vietnam and reaching the South China Sea.

On December 15, 2020, David R. Stilwell, assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs spoke at the Stimson Center think tank.  He announced the launch of the Mekong Dam Monitor. According Mr. Stilwell, the project with funding from the US State Department will be implemented by the above-mentioned think tank together with Eyes on Earth, a US-based research and consulting company. This monitor project plans to weekly update data on the state of water in Mekong (this encloses reservoir level readings, temperature, chemical composition, etc) while using remote sensing tools and high-resolution satellite images. There are 28 dams in the list including tributary ones. It is assumed that the US side will share this information with Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.

A senior American official grasped the chance to attack China. Mr. Stilwell accused Beijing of the lack of transparency in running its 11 hydro-power dams. These dams allegedly restrain the annual discharge in a volume from 20 to 40 billion cubic meters. This results in constant severe droughts in the lower Mekong basin and causes serious injury to economics and food security of neighbor countries. This particularly falls upon fishery and reduces irrigation capacity. All that is having a negative impact on welfare of 240 million people living in the region. Mr. assistant secretary also underlined that China has 'its hands on other countries' throats' by controlling the Mekong streambed.

It has to be said that the American project was launched several weeks later after the start of the similar PRC program. Chinese promised to exchange data with their partners throughout a year. Earlier such obligation extended just to the flood season.

Besides, Mekong River Commission (MRC) has been existing since 1957. It unifies Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Its mission is 'to promote and coordinate sustainable management and development of water and related resources for the mutual benefit' of the countries of the Mekong basin. The MRC functions are implementation of strategic programs, as well as scientific knowledge sharing and consultations. This is open information. It is not a new revelation wither for the USA, or for China. Even more, the PRC is the MRC dialogue partner, and the United States is one of Development Partners. For instance, Cambodia halted mainstream Chinese maintained Mekong river dam plans for 10 years without prompting by an American 'Big Brother.'

It is quite clear that we've been witnessing of another round of the stand-off between Washington and Beijing in the region. At the end of the day, it would come down to active manipulations of information by the USA and China aiming to embarrass each other and to play their cards. The White House will continue discrediting Beijing and blaming the Communist party for natural disasters in the region. The CPR, for its part, will handle payback.

Meanwhile, the majority of people int the region lives below the poverty line. And there is no escape from this misery. On the one hand, Khmer way of living and household has been harmoniously connected with an aquatic eco-system. On the other hand, all the infrastructure outside tourist routs which includes schools and hospitals lacks electricity, sanitation, and other blessings of civilization. I am sure that none of Chinese or American officials have ever seen those terrible conditions my co-nationals been living in.

As a person born in that part of the world, it pains me to see those powers playing their geopolitical games in our territories and pursuing their vested interests. Their activities have already led to slow-down of currents and decline in sediment in Mekong. Which means less nutrition for plants and fish in the river, threatening the ecological balance. We will face macroclimate changes caused by rude interference into Mekong ecological system. I'm sure that Mr. Stilwell will confidently use this fact for hurling into his Chinese colleague, either. It won't fix the situation in ASEAN region, though.",1612964198

The pathbreaking [report](https://councilonstrategicrisks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/The-Security-Threat-That-Binds-Us_2021_2-1.pdf), ‚Äú*The Security Threat That Binds Us: The Unraveling of Ecological and Natural Security and What the United States Can Do About It*,‚Äù focuses on the security ramifications from large-scale destabilization and transformation of the biosphere, and ecosystems shifting to new baseline states. The report offers recommendations based on three  fundamental precepts: heightened action from both the U.S. Congress and  the Executive Branch to combat ecological and natural security   disruptions; a greater infusion of science and scientific expertise into  the national security communities; and a reboot of U.S. national  security doctrine and architecture to tackle the modern threats  presented by a changing planet and degradation of its embedded socioecological systems.

I go to Texas A&amp;M where there's either Environmental Studies or Bioenvironmental Science (In the Ag &amp; Life Sciences college, I'm not a huge geoscience person) and the latter gears you a lot towards EHS and water quality stuff which is why I didn't choose it.

70,ecology,Intro information on substrates in ecology,"There are many different definitions of substrate, in ecology though, a substrate refers to the material on which an organism lives. An example of an organism living in a substrate would be when sea anemones attach themselves to rocks in very turbulent areas. It then obtains nutrients by capturing food with its tentacles. Some organisms obtain nutrients from the substrate itself, bread mold consumes its substrate, the bread, to obtain nutrients. Some substrates are more unsuitable for organisms to live in, the dessert soil is a substrate that does not hold water and has little organic material.

72,ecology,Some things that may harm the environment.," 

Whenever there is pest, farmers will use pesticides to get rid of them. It is estimated that 50% of the world‚Äôs food production would have been lost to pests if pesticides were not used. However, with the misuse of pesticides, pesticides themselves can create problems. Some pesticides do not kill a specific type of pests, so bugs that are helpful for the environment are caught in the crossfire. One example is when spraying pesticides to kill armyworms, bees are killed too. Bees are important for the pollination of canola and other crops.

Fertilizers, a substance that is used to enrich the soil to increase the growth quality of plants. Usually you would think that fertilizers are helpful for the environment, they are helpful until there too much are applied. Any plant when given more nutrients than the optimum amount will begin to die. Fertilizers can also enter ponds, streams, lakes, or rivers and may disturb those ecosystems by changing the concentration of nutrients. Which can lead to fishes dying in the water.

Solid waste, which is garbage, is disposed of through landfills: solid waste is thrown into a massive hole called a landfill which is then buried in dirt. This is dangerous because when groundwater passes through a landfill, it produces a highly toxic substance called leachate. Leachate can then possibly travel to the nearest pond, lake or river and contaminate it. Sanitary landfills are being made to prevent water from leaking to the landfill. Despite this, solid waste is still dangerous to the atmosphere. Some hazardous waste is burned in incinerators which contribute to air pollution.

Wastewater that is a combination of dissolved and undissolved materials from your kitchen, bathroom, and laundry is called sewage. Sewage usually moves through pipes and is sent to a septic tank or to a sewage treatment plant. Treated wastewater or effluent is then released into a nearby lake or river. This treated wastewater may contain nitrogen and phosphorus which can change the concentration of nutrients in that body of water. If the sewage system cannot handle a large quantity of rainwater from street drains, it may go directly into a river or lake through storm sewers. These storm sewers contain chemicals that were washed off from the streets.

74,ecology,Why isn‚Äôt there an international ‚Äúecological consultant‚Äù certificate like ISA arborists or clinical psychologists?,"To be called an arborist means you have to be a licensed arborist from the International Society of Arboriculture. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy, though; four years of work experience if you don‚Äôt have any formal education in a similar field (forestry counts, not ecology) and an exam that isn‚Äôt easy to pass. Then, once you ARE an arborist, you have to get 30 Continued Education Unit (CEU) points per year as a way of staying on top of the latest developments and new knowledge in the arboriculture industry and be ‚Äúup to date.‚Äù But these points are HARD to get as well; you can get them from conferences and seminars, but if you don‚Äôt have those opportunities, there are online, ISA quizzes you can do for 0.5‚Äì1 CEU point each.

You might say ‚ÄúYeah, but that‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt need a degree in arboriculture to be an arborist.‚Äù Okay, let‚Äôs look at clinical psychologists for a second. If you go to university for a degree in psychology, you can‚Äôt call yourself a psychologist. You first need to get a Masters, where you need to spend time in a clinic and practice on patience while ALSO doing a thesis. Once you‚Äôve graduated, THEN you can call yourself a psychologist and attend patients.

Then you might say ‚ÄúYeah, if you need to deal with health, you gotta be certified, trees aren‚Äôt people and don‚Äôt need a certificate.‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs go to ecologists, or rather, ‚Äúecological consultants.‚Äù You go to university and take one of ANY environment-related course, of which there are hundreds, if not THOUSANDS going by different names. These can be (but not limited to): environmental science; environmental sustainability; ecology; conservation; or wildlife biology. The focus of these degrees might not necessarily be the same, though. A conservation course might have modules/units on law and policy, protected area management, and ecology, but environmental science might have stuff on pollution and waste management, geology, or atmospheric science. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the difference between the courses listed above and their marine equivalent (e.g. marine science, marine biology). But when you graduate, you can join a consultancy and become...a consultant? Like, you can plan surveys to collect data rapidly, write the report, calculate/predict/model impact, and provide mitigation measures/offsets to reduce your impacts on ecosystems that can be hundreds or thousands of years old? Yes, there is the International Association for Impact Assessment and the Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management, but you don‚Äôt need to be a member of either of those organizations to be called a consultant.

Why is it that, at one end, you legally have to be certified by an international society to call yourself an arborist, while at the other you have to go through brutal academic and clinical training before being able to attend to patience, while neither things are required to be an ecological consultant? I know you can do a MSc or Masters by Coursework to improve yourself (or even a PhD), but you don‚Äôt HAVE to in order to be called an ecological consultant. Given that conservation, environmental sustainability, natural resource management, and sustainable development are going to be the way forward to ensure the survival of everything on the planet (us included), why hasn‚Äôt the industry as a whole come together and say ‚Äúfor the sake of our planet, you need to be certified‚Äù? Is it a competition thing? Like, it‚Äôs not in the best interest of companies to create this standard because really poor-quality consultants and companies will be left behind? But wouldn‚Äôt such good standards help the environment? Or is it because the laws for environmental protection between countries are so different that it makes it hard to come up with a single standard of environmental protections? But if that‚Äôs the case, how are arborists and clinical psychologists a thing? Or is it that the industry isn‚Äôt ‚Äúready‚Äù yet?",1612269892

Abstract: Tropical forests are under increasing pressure, but conservation interventions have had only limited success in mitigating deforestation and ecosystem degradation. Over the past decade, however, jurisdictional approaches to sustainable resource use have attracted increasing attention as a potential alternative to traditional conservation strategies. These approaches operate within formal administrative boundaries and seek to establish policies and practices that apply to all stakeholders. We compiled a global database of conservation initiatives and developed a definition and typology for jurisdictional approaches; of the 80 initiatives included in our database, 25 met this definition. We categorized these jurisdictional approaches according to two criteria: the focus of the intervention and the degree of government involvement. These jurisdictions encompassed approximately 40% of global tropical forests, with most experiencing higher‚Äêthan‚Äêaverage deforestation rates. Although jurisdictional approaches harbor the potential to overcome the limitations of previous approaches, numerous challenges for implementation and operation remain. In addition, because most jurisdictional initiatives currently in operation are still early in their lifecycles, the long‚Äêterm effectiveness of this strategy has yet to be proven.",1612153153

91,ecology,Book to start with for British environmentalist,"Hello üôÇ I'm British and I've been fond of the countryside for years. This has grown into an obsessive environmentalism/naturalism. I feel a belonging in my local habitats (woodland and fields). Pollution in general disgusts me. I find rewilding to be an exciting and creative way of helping our damaged environment and I hope to some day partake. I'm also writing a very nature-fond fiction book (think Lord of the Rings) and so I want to get my pristine image of temperate forest living beside agrarian society right.

It's occurred to me that beyond listing tree species, biomes and my basic ideas of habitats and the basic ecology of rewilding (natural succession, niches, keystone species), all I can do is echo sentiments about the importance of bogs, the unhealth of grouse moorland, the increased risk of flooding (a big problem here) due to deforestation and destruction of wetlands, the worrying prospect of soil erosion, and how sheep and deer are wrecking the landscape (sorry chaps), I don't understand the nitty gritty details of it all, the ecology. I can't look at a bog or a heath or a wood or a field and go, aha! this is what is happening here, and you see what's happened there, and you see this means it's unhealthy or healthy, and so on, like someone might in a documentary.

I'd like to progress beyond being a tree-hugging, heather-loving, adventurer of forbidden fields to someone who actually knows what the hell is going on in and between these habitats, and why do these habitats even exist in the first place. This is partly out of a simple passion for the great outdoors but also so maybe I could get involved with rewilding some day, so I can have an informed opinion on what should be done beyond zealous opinions I've come across. I want to have something useful to say beyond, 'Trees good. Plastic bad.'

I want to go beyond YouTube or Twitter or Reddit (sorry) as my source of environmental knowledge. I think that a book or two that provides accessible (I'm neither biologist nor statistician) and sweeping coverage of this kind of subject matter, specifically with reference to Northern Hemisphere ecosystems if possible, would be the best way of learning about ecology in a structured, apolitical manner. But I don't know where the bloody hell to start because there are so many books to choose from! So I hope you can help üôÇ

WE NEED YOUR HELP

A study by the University of Exeter is aiming to inform efforts for reducing the transmission risk of COVID-19 from tourists to **Wild Great Apes** in Africa. Ultimately, to produce education materials for tourist sites across Africa.

We have lots of partners working on this, including Conservation Through Public Health, Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas, Robert Koch Institute, Bristol Zoological Society and the IUCN Primate Specialist Group COVID-19 Working Group.

Your views and opinions really matter to this study! So, if you have a spare 20 minutes, I would be so grateful if you could fill out this questionnaire (link below) and share it amongst your networks.

Abstract: 

Impacts of invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus on native species and ecosystems are widely recognised, but mostly through small‚Äêscale studies and laboratory experiments that may not always reflect impacts in nature. Recorded effects of signal crayfish on fish populations are equivocal. In this study, using the before‚Äìafter/control‚Äìimpact and control‚Äìimpact approaches, the effects of signal crayfish invasion on native fishes, particularly benthic fishes and young‚Äêof‚Äêyear (YoY) salmonids, and macroinvertebrate communities, were determined on several spatial and temporal scales through three correlated study elements (S1‚ÄìS3), in upland streams of the River Tees, England.

In S1, we sampled fish and benthic macroinvertebrates of 18 streams identically in 2011 and 2018. These streams were categorised into two groups: (1) uninvaded (without signal crayfish in both sampling years; n = 7); and (2) invaded (with signal crayfish) streams, comprising pre‚Äêinvaded (invaded before 2011; n = 8) and newly invaded (invaded between 2011 and 2018, n = 3). Despite similar habitat conditions in both years (all variables p &gt; 0.05) fish and macroinvertebrate communities changed over time in pre‚Äêinvaded streams and by comparison to uninvaded streams. A decline in the abundance of benthic fish and YoY salmonids was observed in pre‚Äêinvaded and newly invaded streams. Complete disappearance of bullhead Cottus perifretum following signal crayfish invasion was recorded in two pre‚Äêinvaded streams.

In the second study, S2, we assessed within‚Äêstream differences in fishes and macroinvertebrates in two Tees streams by comparing sections with (invaded) and without (uninvaded) signal crayfish. Compared to uninvaded sections, taxonomic richness and abundance of fish and macroinvertebrates were significantly lower in invaded sections, and the overall communities also differed significantly.

In S3, long‚Äêterm data series (since 1990) of water quality and macroinvertebrates of six Tees streams comprising those invaded by signal crayfish (n = 3) and uninvaded (n = 3) were analysed. Water quality showed little change, or an improvement, over time but significant changes in the macroinvertebrate taxonomic richness and community structure occurred following signal crayfish invasion. Long‚Äêterm changes in macroinvertebrate communities in invaded streams tended to be due to declines in more sedentary taxa such as molluscs and cased trichopterans.

Widespread and long‚Äêterm ecological disruption is occurring because of signal crayfish invasion in upland streams of the Tees catchment that may lead to a complete disappearance of some benthic fish species, as well as reduced densities of YoY salmonids and a shift towards less diverse macroinvertebrate communities, dominated by more mobile, crayfish‚Äêresistant taxa.",1611549223

So to make a long story short. This summer I'll get my bachelors degree in the field of medicine. During the bachelors, I've grown an interest in ecology and have been doing projects related to the field as well as reading on my own. If I had the option, I'd go back and do a bachelors in biology instead. Now, I've applied for a masters degree starting autumn -21, and it's not unlikely I'll get accepted. However I'm wondering if I'm doing myself a disservice by jumping onto an ecology masters without any foundation really in ecology - that is I haven't studied any ecology/botany/zoology at the undergraduate level and what knowledge I have about the area is from my own studies. So I'm wondering whether or not it's better to wait one year with the masters and do all these courses mentioned and apply for the ecology master autumn -22. At the same time, I may very well complete the masters and do just fine since I'm very dedicated, but still I will certainly miss out on foundational knowledge of ecology by going that route.

The main issue of doing undergraduate courses for another year is of financial nature, as well as minor anxiety due to my age (I started studying late in life).

Abstract: Numerous studies have documented changes in the seasonal timing of organisms‚Äô growth and reproduction in response to climate warming. These changes correlate with documented changes in species‚Äô abundance, but mechanisms linking these trends remain elusive. We investigated the joint demographic effects of advanced reproductive phenology and warming on a globally invasive plant (Carduus nutans) in a field experiment, documenting a substantial shift toward completion of the life cycle at younger ages. Demographic modeling projected 71% of warmed individuals flower as annuals, compared to 61% under current conditions. As this species only reproduces once, this represents a major acceleration of the life cycle. We project a 15% increase in this invader‚Äôs population growth rate. We show that rising temperatures accelerate this invasive species‚Äô population growth by increasing the average size of reproducing individuals; increasing the proportion of individuals that survive to reproduce; and increasing the fraction that reproduce as annuals. Major increases in population growth in this, and potentially many other, invasive species will threaten food security and require careful planning to avoid significant environmental and economic impacts.",1610949009

Not really sure where to post this so I'm going to try r/zoology and r/ecology in case there is anyone in this kind of job here. 

I'm a second-year undergrad studying an integrated MSci in Ecology and Conservation Biology at uni. I often have crises about careers etc. because I really don't want to go into a 9-5 job...

Recently I discovered the idea of working for as an international wildlife safari/tour guide. I saw someone who does this part-time, getting to travel all over the world and lead tours on all kinds of different cool species, whilst also remaining based in the UK and doing other jobs when they are back home.

I was wondering how on earth one can go into this, what kind of experience/qualifications are needed and how I could get started on this career path post-uni?

96,ecology,identifying rare tree species,"I'm working on a personal project to identify plants of the Brazilian 'cerrado' biome in my family's ranch. My goal is to better understand species there as they are in high risk of being cleared to make more room for cattle. If I could identify any rare (endangered or vulnerable) tree species, I could tag them and try to protect them from being cleared.

I haven't yet gotten to go to the field, but I have been preparing by researching and trying to identify local plants. And I've found it far harder than in the US due to 1) greater biodiversity and 2) fewer resources. I can usually get to genus level, but not species. This isn't good enough. I've compiled a list of officially registered tree species in the state and in the local area of the ranch. However, these obviously don't include all species, and are most likely to exclude rare species.

I found a database called ""[theplantlist.org](https://theplantlist.org)"" which supposedly has all known plant species, but I struggle to find anything on identifying characteristics. How would proper scientists go about identifying rare species (what resources do they use?)",1610651040

They are a symptom of a larger ecological process and act as opportunist working within the perfect environmental factors that allow them to pervade and outcompete ‚Äúnative‚Äù species.  It seems as though they are merely creating the grounds for what will become a new suite of species complexes and enforce evolutionary pressures that will create new species, force existing species to adapt, or allow species from other areas to join symbiotically (not always meaning mutually). In saying this my point comes in that I find it very hard to ever justify using pesticides to temporarily evict a certain species. It costs a lot of money to conduct, it is hardly ever effective and if it does have success it is often short term only delaying the eventual onset of another ‚Äúinvasion,‚Äù and it is ecological harmful in so many ways (indirect killing of nearby species, drastic changes in soil biology and chemistry, pollution, etc.). I understand that there are other ways such as biological, mechanical and or manually removing them but these methods are so arduous that you never feel as if you are getting anywhere, because you‚Äôre not, especially at a landscape level. I very much understand that it is important to maintain biodiversity, but are we holding onto species because we really care about them or is that we like a certain species more than another and want to keep it around for our own pleasure (aesthetics, nostalgia, human use). Is it not already written in our ecological understanding that mass extinction events happen, species move around the world and through disturbance and altered environmental factors, new life arises?

The vast number of insect species and the challenging task of studying them makes entomology the perfect playground for collaborative efforts, in this case between biologists, statisticians, and mechanical, electrical and software engineers. In the paper, we demonstrate the relevance of high-tech solutions in entomological research.

15,ecology,Idea for food production and ocean plastic reduction.,"Okay so i have a weird idea im hoping to discuss.... if we where able to effectively classify plastics, say via near inferred spectrometry to find the melting points for individual plastics we could collect and repurpose the plastics in the ocean, right? 
Anyway if we where to collect, classify and repurpose the plastics could we use the plastics to make floating farms on the ocean using hydroponics or aquaponics grow crops. The plastic for this could be crude without affecting its intended use. We could use solar powered barges to collect, classify and variable kilns to compress and mold the plastics. I think this would be a cost effective method to farming without using massive amounts of land and hopefully removing the amount of plastics in the ocean. We could use solar panels to provide the energy needed for the farming or build greenhouses from the crude plastic. Theres a few issues i worry about when thinking about this.
1) the degredation of plastics exposed to salty ocean
2) the affect on aquatic life, though it may be outweighed by the benifits of removing plastic
3) the repurposing of the plastics, plastics are hard to recycle due to inconsistent melting temps.

Im not a proffesional or well educated in the relevent feilds for this discussion. Which is why im hoping to talk about this to try and see what kinks may come up and what i can look into.",1610437179

Abstract: Article impact statement: Combining native and non‚Äênative species to evaluate biodiversity is overly simplistic and may undermine the conservation of ecosystems.

Introduction: Wallach et al. (2019) propose including all non‚Äênative species when determining species richness, distribution, and threat status for biodiversity management and conservation purposes. Although contesting prevailing conservation paradigms is a useful way to critically examine and refine practice and policy, we argue that their proposal would lead to an artificial inflation in species counts and downplay the harm some non‚Äênative species cause to native species, human livelihoods, culture, and safety. Their approach, therefore, risks poor outcomes for conservation and society.",1610377524
19,ecology,Hoping for a career advice,"Hello everyone,

I am hoping to get some career advice since I am at a huge crossroads now. If anyone has the time, I will really appreciate it. I have a bachelor's degree in biology and am just about to finish my master's degree in ecology now. I am at the beginning of my career path, but have some experience that I gained doing temp jobs while I was studying.

I now have two job offers and no idea which one to take. The first one is a job in a very big, international pharmaceutical company known worldwide (and also based in a lot of different countries all over the world) and the main task is dealing with documentation regarding analytical procedures. The other one is at a research centre for microbiology, where I would be doing lab work as a lab technician. The job is available because one employee will be going on a maternity leave which is a year long in my country. This person doesn't have a university degree, just high school diploma, so I would be hired based on my high school diploma, not my bachelor's degree, meaning it's a very entry level job, so no fancy stuff, but I would gain knowledge on a couple of different lab methods (lab is mainly dealing with diagnosing viral infections). The pharmaceutical job is better paid, both are only for a year, but with the pharmaceutical job there is a much bigger chance of contract renewal. However that does not mean a lot to me, because I will be looking into moving out of the country in a year or so (has always been a dream of mine).

My question is, which job do you think has more value on my CV? Or which one would better help me get another biology or ecology related job? I obviously think it is the lab job, but since it's a very entry level job where I would only gain very basic lab skills, I am not so sure. Plus I kind of think I would have more doors open for me abroad with the pharmaceutical job (even though I am a biologist), but I really don't have much experience and don't know what to do.

I must say that I do not have any laboratory skills yet (apart from a couple month long temp job where I was dealing with water quality and water invertebrates) and I have worked for 10 months in that same pharmaceutical company before. I am based in Europe and will be moving to another EU country and I will try to find a job beforehand. I also don't speak any other EU languages apart from English and my native language, so I will have no knowledge of the language of the country that I will be moving into. That's why I was thinking maybe a job in another international pharmaceutical company would be easier to find in another EU country. I must say that I do not really enjoy working for a pharmaceutical company, it just seems like the more secure option to go with. But on the other hand, surely lab skills would help me get another job in ecology or biology?

43,ecology,A (hopefully) feasible idea for the long term conservation of species.," 

As you probably know, there are many species around the world whose populations have been reduced to critically low numbers and face extinction within the century. These species, particularly in tropics, often have little or no active conservation groups working to protect them, either because of lack of funds or the non-committal attitude that some countries take towards preserving nature.

I was thinking about this seemingly unsolvable problem before I had an idea that could possibly work. If scientists took genome samplings from the last few individuals of species which have little hope for survival and preserved them in computer files, we would then effectively have a digital library of the species' biodiversity even after the physical animals or plants perish. Then, in the best case scenario, after the world's human population growth starts leveling off and farming practices grow less spacious, we could do our best to regrow native habitats around the world and regain some of what was lost in terms of habitat. In that case, scientists could use the genomic data to recreate the formerly extinction population and restarts the species with a better outlook than before.

I am aware that with our current technology such a thing would be impossible: we can't construct a genome from scratch, we can't accurately simulate the conditions needed for an embryo to grow artificially, and so on. However, what's impossible today might not be impossible in say, 500 years. All the technology needed are logically feasible (at least in my head) but a LOT more research and experimentation need to be done to get there. In any case, I think that might be the only chance to save a lot of species nearing extinction today.",1610120728

The [Red-tailed Bumblebees‚Äôs](https://www.bumblebeeconservation.org/red-tailed-bumblebees/red-tailed-bumblebee/) scientific name is Bombus lapidarius, bombus simply meaning bee and lapidarius meaning ‚Äòrelating to stones‚Äô, referring to the small mounds of tiny gravel found where a bumblebee has dug a nest. 

It is a common and easily identifiable Bumblebee on the fells and moors of Northern England, although numbers have declined in recent years like many other bee species. The [females](https://images.app.goo.gl/wJXsNLbgkBqdprU58)  are jet black with striking red ends to their abdomens, indeed they were commonly known as ‚Äòred-arsed‚Äô bumblebees until prudish Victorians altered their common name to something deemed less crude in guides of the time. The [male](https://images.app.goo.gl/DSfQrrYERr5RdtE69) is similar in appearance to the female but with red hairs on the hindlegs and a yellow/orange collar and head, their tails, or behinds, might appear more of an orange colour later in the year as they tend to fade, a bit like a wooly jumper might fade in the sun. 

The flight period of the Red-tailed Bumblebee is 
from March to October and they can be found in a variety of habitats. In the height of summer they will visit verges and wildflower meadows where they will pollinate [Thistles](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/kpcd7y/the_melancholy_thistle/), [Orchids](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/k31b5k/the_bee_orchid/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) , [Globeflowers](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/jy3fjo/the_globeflower/), Buttercups, [Hayrattle](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/jw8oha/hay_rattle/), Dandelions and other flowers. 

Later in the year the heather moorlands will be buzzing with them as they fly between the blooms of [Cross-leaved heather](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/irwvtv/erica_tetralix_crossleaved_heather/), Bellheather and [Bilberries](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j0rpct/bilberries/), they will also pollinate the flowers of hedgerow plants such as [Blackthorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/j4fpig/sloe_or_blackthorn/), Gorse, Foxgloves and [Hawthorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/kfvdzz/hawthorn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) . 

In very late summers when it is still warm enough for them to fly but most plants have gone to fruit they have occasionally been observed eating aphids as an alternative food source, how often they resort to this is not known.

They will cover a lot of distance in a days foraging, up to 3 miles from their colony, and are able to fly up to 35mph which means they can fly against moderate hilltop breezes which would ground other flying insects, this gives them a competitive edge and means that quite often they are one of the only bees you will see on the moors.

The lifecycle of the Red-tailed Bumblebee is quite similar to that of other species, in the first warm days of spring you will see the large queens flying about the first flowers, they are gathering nectar and pollen for their newly hatching brood. A queen Bumblebee will have found a suitable place to build her [nest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI6Igwp0OCY)  first, this will be deep in dry leaf litter, a hole in dry ground ,in a drystone wall, fence post or tree or quite often in the wall of an [old barn](https://www.reddit.com/r/ForestofBowland/comments/ippbyg/boosesboskins_and_rudsticks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) These  places will all have one thing in common which is that they will be dry, not prone to water logging and south facing to catch the morning sun in the spring.

In this dry, warm and safe [place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNkFBJ6OZYI)  the queen will make a nest in which she will lay just a few eggs at a time, around half a dozen, these eggs will hatch into worker bees which support the colony and their queen. The Queen will continue to lay eggs in this nest throughout the year but as the workers mature they will do all the work of gathering food, defending and cleaning out rubbish from the nest, this gives the queen a chance to rest until later in the year. 

In late summer the queen will lay eggs which are destined to become next year's queen bees as well as ones which will develop into drones or male bees. A drones only purpose is to mate with the queens which will develop new colonies the next year. Queen bees will ensure that these larvae grow to become drones or queens instead of common workers by feeding them a special food secreted from a gland called a hypopharynx, this food is called ‚Äò[royal jelly](https://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/royal-jelly) ‚Äô and contains hormones which trigger the development of sexual organs which the workers, which aren‚Äôt fed royal jelly, don‚Äôt have.

When autumn arrives and brings with it the first cold nights the old queen, her workers and the drones will all die, leaving only the newly mated queens alive, they will find leave and find somewhere quiet, warm and draft free to hibernate until the next spring.

Their main predators are animals which can dig up their nests such as Mice, Foxes and Badgers, when a [Badger](https://images.app.goo.gl/cNrg9vEV2pdtn3KB7)  has destroyed a Bumblebee nest there will be a hole scraped out in the ground surrounded by bits of dried grass and moss which the queen had painstakingly gathered to insulate it and make it snug, increases in the populations of Badgers in recent years have led to sharp declines in bee numbers with some species becoming locally extinct where there are high numbers of Badgers, this is a problem that conservationists are desperately trying to find some kind of solution to as pollinating insects such as the Red-tailed Bumblebee are a vital part of ecological cycles and chains and without them whole ecosystems would collapse. 

Projects such the rejuvenation and creation of [wildflower](http://www.bloomsforbees.co.uk/gardening/habitats/) gardens and traditional hay meadows, continued management of heather moorlands, hedgerow and tree planting and smaller, yet still important, schemes such as simply not mowing roadside verges and installing man made nesting boxes, means that they will have more and more wildflowers and places to nest in the future which will go a long way to helping secure the future of these busy, attractive and vital bees.",1610072889

Brief intro: I'm a 2nd year graduate student in a Forest Ecology program, with thesis work focusing on native forest bee response to disturbances (fire, forest management).
One of my thesis chapters involves a study that I began as an undergraduate and developed into a larger project for my graduate degree. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to approach analysis? I'm obviously in contact with my advisor/committee, but I feel having additional commentary is more helpful than not. Also not looking for anything overly specific...
Here's the DL:
The first year of sampling I collected data at 14 plots representative of 2 different treatments. Did not collect floral data. 
The second year of sampling I collected data at 26 plots representative of 3 different treatments. I did collect floral data.

My questions:
1. Is it possible to analyze this data as a whole? Or will I need to separate the two years and keep it at that.
2. Would it be best to 'scrap' the year 1 data and write my thesis chapter on the data I collected in year 2? I know two years+ of data collection is staple...
3. Any papers out there with similar a similar situation/context?

However I cannot find an exact, falsifiable definition of this term (for example, what factors exactly would define when a new community is established?). 

I would love if someone could recommend a textbook or resource that puts all these terms into a proper framework.

Abstract: Global landscapes are changing due to human activities with consequences for both biodiversity and ecosystems. For single species, terrestrial mammal population densities have shown mixed responses to human pressure, with both increasing and decreasing densities reported in the literature. How the impacts of human activities on mammal populations translates into altered global density patterns remains unclear. Here we aim to disentangle the effect of human impacts on large‚Äêscale patterns of mammal population densities using a global dataset of 6729 population density estimates for 468 mammal species (representing 59% and 44% of mammalian orders and families). We fitted a mixed effect model to explain the variation in density based on a 1‚Äêdegree resolution as a function of the human footprint index (HFI), a global proxy of direct and indirect human disturbances, while accounting for body mass, trophic level and primary productivity (normalized vegetation index; NDVI). We found a significant positive relationship between population density and HFI, where population densities were higher in areas with a higher HFI (e.g. agricultural or suburban areas ‚Äì no populations were located in very high HFI urban areas) compared to areas with a low HFI (e.g. wilderness areas). We also tested the effect of the individual components of the HFI and still found a consistent positive effect. The relationships remained positive even across populations of the same species, although variability among species was high. Our results indicate shifts in mammal population densities in human modified landscapes, which is due to the combined effect of species filtering, increased resources and a possible reduction in competition and predation. Our study provides further evidence that macroecological patterns are being altered by human activities, where some species will benefit from these activities, while others will be negatively impacted or even extirpated.",1609733002

82,ecology,"Need someone to review this essay on Cellular Respiration, and Photosynthesis, based on the picture I took of nature","My teacher told us to go out into nature‚Äö and take a photograph with e.g. a mobile camera. My task is to explain with the help of this picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds, map onto each other. Using the picture, I am supposed to also explain the carbon cycle. Here is the [picture ](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/698789712386588682/775735800146427904/unknown.png) I took. Below, you will find what I answered on this essay, and would appreciate if you could review it (no need on the grammar).

&gt; I know that the processes of photosynthesis, and cellular respiration, recycle a common set of chemicals: water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and organic compounds such as glucose. But here, we don't see any glucose, because I take it to be something edible, and leaves in this picture is not edible. Further, the water in this picture is evaporating, leading to water going from one form to another, i.e. from liquid to gas. 

&gt; Glucose and other energy-rich substances that living things depend on, are derived from plants (and cyanobacteria). The plants have a unique ability to produce an organic substance from inorganic substances. Namely, they form glucose from carbon dioxide and water. It is the carbon dioxide that contributes the carbon atoms to the chain of carbon atoms that form the ""backbone"" or base of any organic molecule, in this instance, the glucose molecules. 

&gt; In addition to carbon dioxide and water, energy is required to produce glucose, which is ""charged"" with energy. The plants solve this by converting light energy from the sun, and with the help of the green substance chlorophyll, light energy is collected inside the plant. Since light is used as an energy source, the plants' production of glucose is called photosynthesis (photo = light, synthesis = composition).

&gt; In addition to glucose, oxygen is formed during photosynthesis. The oxygen gas is formed because the reactants carbon dioxide and water contain more oxygen atoms than are required for glucose production. The plants emit oxygen to the environment. Basically, photosynthesis can be described as such: 

&gt; light energy + carbon dioxide + water ‚Üí glucose + oxygen 

&gt; In order for the carbon and hydrogen atoms to be sufficient for one glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide, and six water molecules, are required. These contain an excess of oxygen atoms, and therefore, six oxygen molecules are also formed.

&gt; Most people living on this planet are dependent on plants because they need oxygen for cellular respiration. The oxygen present in the atmosphere has been formed by photosynthesis. Plants also need oxygen. It is easy to understand why animals and humans need cellular respiration.

&gt; For plants, light energy can not be saved or transported in a plant. Energy-rich molecules, on the other hand, can be saved and transported. Because the plants' cells use glucose as fuel, they can also get energy at night when it is dark. In addition, glucose can be transported to the cells of the roots, which also need energy. 

&gt; Since plants also have cellular respiration, they are also dependent on the formation of oxygen during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are used up while glucose and oxygen are formed. During cellular respiration, the opposite happens. Glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, and water. In this way, the constituent substances participate in a cycle and do not end up on Earth. Photosynthesis is powered by light energy.

&gt; During cellular respiration, the corresponding amount of energy is released. This is finally converted into heat that radiates from the organisms. Over time, the heat also radiates from the atmosphere and further into space. This means that the energy cannot be reused in a cycle. It flows through the system and therefore life on earth is constantly dependent on new energy from the sun.

&gt; During photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemically-bound energy into glucose. Through cellular respiration and other processes, chemically-bound energy is finally converted into heat that leaves the Earth. Therefore, new energy from the sun is always needed. Substances, on the other hand, can be included in cycles and do not have to run out.",1609515526

91,ecology,Should I join a good but not perfect lab for my MS? Or wait another year and hope to get into a better lab?,"I am applying to grad schools for fall ‚Äô21 and find myself in a bit of a predicament.  All programs would have either an RAship or TAship providing a stipend and covering tuition

I‚Äôm applying to a few MS programs, two are long shots but I would really like to go to them.  (I‚Äôve talked to PIs for both and they told me to apply, then they choose the best applicants for the RA‚Äôships.  Competitive labs so who knows if I will get in).  

The third program seems like I will get in and get accepted to the lab.  But I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I should accept.  I‚Äôm already 25 and plan to do a PhD after this MS, and I don‚Äôt want to wait yet another year if I don‚Äôt join this lab, but I‚Äôm also not totally sure its the best for me.  I think I would have better chances of being accepted into additional programs if I waited a year and applied again (I think this because COVID caused a lot of funding issues for people and departments, and also because two PIs told me they couldn‚Äôt take me this year but would be ‚Äúquite interested‚Äù in potentially taking me in 2022 if I am still looking (obviously this isn‚Äôt a guarantee))

Pros: 
Project topic is exactly what I want to study, very interesting and exciting to me.  project is broken into two parts.  Part one is guaranteed, part two would only happen if we could get additional funding (PI says he has pretty good track record of him and his students applying to similar grants).

I don‚Äôt have to wait another year to start graduate school, I kind of feel like my life is going nowhere right now and I really want to move forward

Cons:
Main con: subject could be studied in the field or via experiments in the lab.  The project would be exclusively lab experiment based, no field work.  Being in the field is one of my favorite parts about this work and also I think having more field experience would be really helpful for eventually doing the PhD that I would like to do.  I could maybe do some volunteering on the side for other students projects to get a bit of field experience but this isn‚Äôt ideal

Part 2 of the project is dependent on funding which may or may not come, without this part the research isn‚Äôt as good and I don‚Äôt learn a skill that I would like to learn

students in the lab have told me the PI is ultimately a good guy who cares about his students, but he is very critical/light on praise.  I work best with people who offer more positive feedback and to be honest, I don‚Äôt take harsh criticism very well.  With that being said, my current boss is also like this and I‚Äôve learned to work with him and overall have had a positive experience, so I think I could handle it 

No lab meetings/lit reviews- I benefit from these things and enjoy them (although not having them does give me more free time to work on research and coursework)

The city I would have to move to for this is definitely not my ideal place to live (very suburban and spread out, I am more of an urban city or walkable college town type guy)

I‚Äôm partially just venting here, but does anyone have any thoughts on what I should do here?  Its ultimately my decision but it would be good to hear some perspectives.  Thanks.",1609294600

Keeping this in mind, I'm curious if anyone has input on LGBTQ+ attitudes (particularly for trans individuals) in Ecology, particularly on the research/academia side of things - the experiences I've had at my own college have been really positive, but I don't know if they're the norm or not.

I guess going off of that, is this something I should be mentioning in job applications/interviews? I'd like to be up-front, but I'm worried about it affecting my chances somehow.

Abstract: 

The UN declared 2021‚Äì2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and this opens new opportunities for restoration ecologists. 

We argue that ecosystem restoration will be most effective if approached from a social-ecological perspective. 

We synthesize key insights from the field of social-ecological systems research that are particularly relevant for ecosystem restoration.

The United Nations (UN) recently declared 2021 to 2030 the Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Against this background, we review recent social-ecological systems research and summarize key themes that could help to improve ecosystem restoration in dynamic social contexts. The themes relate to resilience and adaptability, ecosystem stewardship and navigation of change, relational values, the coevolution of human and ecological systems, long-range social-ecological connections, and leverage points for transformation. We recommend two cross-cutting new research foci; namely: (i) post hoc cross-sectional assessments of social-ecological restoration projects; and (ii) transdisciplinary social-ecological ‚Äòliving labs‚Äô that accompany new restoration projects as they unfold. With global agendas increasingly taking a social-ecological perspective, the recasting of ecosystem restoration as a social-ecological endeavor offers exciting new opportunities for both research and practice.",1609128329

6,ecology,Advice on a career path as an ecological consultant?,"This is going to be a bit long so please bare with me - TLDR at the end. 

I've come to a firm decision that I want to become an ecological consultant after meandering between environmental scientist, consultant, even lawyer. I'm currently doing an interdisciplinary MSc in Environmental Strategy in the UK. I haven't decided on my dissertation project yet (the deadline looms). Not to sound too cheesy but I really am passionate about ecology. When I did my BSc in General Biology and took the ecology-related courses, I *knew* that this was what I wanted to specialise in. I ended up doing a double major in Biology and Environmental Science because of it. I'm 25 now and got my BSc in 2019. 

My biggest issue - and insecurity - is that I did really poorly for my BSc (2.62GPA). I'm neurodivergent and had a lot of mental health issues. I'm still struggling but being in the UK now I have much better access to healthcare. But my undergraduate university which is based in the Middle East wasn't very accommodating and my grades were all over the place. Still, I got B's in basically all the ecology/environmental management courses. So I know that even though I suffered a lot mentally, I was able to focus hard enough to rack up some semi-decent grades in subjects I was keenly interested in. Nevertheless, studying in the UAE I didn't get a lot of opportunity to engage in a lot of fieldwork and my undergraduate project was heavily lab-based. Basically all my work experience is desk-based too.

The ecological consultancy MSc I applied for earlier this year rejected me and I got really depressed and gave up on that dream, thinking if my grades are that bad (their reasoning for not accepting me into the program), I won't be able to pursue it ever. So I ""settled"" for an environmental consultancy career path - I had some work experience prior and I did enjoy it a lot. As I said before, I've been meandering a lot, but every single time I've reflected on my career choices for the past *decade*, I have this aching desire to pursue a career in ecology. Something that would allow me to be out in nature, explore and study it. 

I know ecological consultancy is more interdisciplinary which is exactly why I think it's perfect for me. I already have some experience in environmental consultancy and I'll be honest, I'm great at it and I loved it. So I want to be realistic, play to my strengths, and remain a part of the interdisciplinary community and my MSc will be really beneficial for that.

I'd just love some insight from anyone else pursuing ecological consultancy or anyone with similar academic background to mine; what pathways I may take. Do I even have potential? Has anyone else struggled with academic performance because they are neurodivergent? How did you overcome it and pursue a successful career?

**TLDR**: I'd just love some advice on how I can strengthen my skills in ecological disciplines and prove myself a worthy candidate as an ecological consultant when my academic background is poor and my work experience is limited. I'm currently based in the UK doing an interdisciplinary MSc in Environmental Strategy with not much opportunity for ecological work other than what I choose to do for my dissertation. I'd also love if anyone can share their own experiences in pursuing a career path like mine.",1609062355
7,ecology,"How do you deal with family/friends who suggest some fairly unethical ways of ""healing the ecosystem""?","This may be an odd post - but I'm curious for others perspectives. 

I find that often when talking with people about my line of work it inevitably turns into a discussion on how damaged much of the worlds ecosystems are. This is especially prevalent around the holidays with family and friends I haven't seen in months. 

However, almost inevitably these discussions take on a tinge of suggestions that border on unethical, racist, or even simply morally repugnant. I can't even describe how often these discussions have shifted recently to people blaming countries such as China for global warming, and my gentle push back about how a traditionally poor nation consuming and using more resources as it becomes wealthier isn't unique to China. It's not that the discussion isn't *valid*, but more that the rationale behind it feels decidedly...""pointed"" to say the least. 

I've had people argue things ranging from limiting the number of children people should be able to have in ""developing"" nations (note - the suggestion here being that larger western nations should decide this), or even advocating that the portions of the world with more intact ecosystems should be forced to not use or develop those resources. I even had one discussion with someone who volunteered in an impoverished foreign country as a nurse who boasted that she had really pushed all the women to get on birth control (even the ones who didn't want to be) because, ""I knew that limiting the population in the area was the only way to save the amazing ecosystem that was there"". I was pretty shocked, and honestly disgusted, that she had used ""saving the ecosystem"" as a justification for pushing birth control on woman who did not really want it, and just kinda wandered away from her in shock. 

I'm usually all for discussing hypothetical solutions in a fun and free manner, but I'm increasingly frustrated that so much of what people suggest is steeped in just a complete lack of ethics. Lately I've just become quick to point things out as problematic, but I've had some family and friends get offended when I don't entertain their ideas. 

Have any of you dealt with this much? How do you cope with it? Do you feed the beast, just shut it down quick, or try and coax them into understanding why what they are suggesting isn't exactly ethical in a more subdued way? I know that ideally the last one is probably the right way to go, but my GOD it can get exhausting.

**(Also just want to acknowledge that I recognize that there are differences of opinion on what is ""unethical"". I think my feeling here is that I'm more put off by a lot of the discussion I have with traditionally wealthy people from Western backgrounds suggesting a lot of the issues of the planet stem from poorer nations that are developing, and that the way to fix these issues lies in somehow controlling those populations. I think it's fairly simply in my view that that is pretty unethical - especially without any of the proper historical/academic context around ecosystem degradation over the past 200 years post industrial revolution).**",1609029773

Abstract: Diversifying agricultural landscapes may mitigate biodiversity declines and improve pest management. Yet landscapes are rarely managed to suppress pests, in part because researchers seldom measure key variables related to pest outbreaks and insecticides that drive management decisions. We used a 13‚Äêyear government database to analyse landscape effects on European grapevine moth (Lobesia botrana) outbreaks and insecticides across c. 400 Spanish vineyards. At harvest, we found pest outbreaks increased four‚Äêfold in simplified, vineyard‚Äêdominated landscapes compared to complex landscapes in which vineyards are surrounded by semi‚Äênatural habitats. Similarly, insecticide applications doubled in vineyard‚Äêdominated landscapes but declined in vineyards surrounded by shrubland. Importantly, pest population stochasticity would have masked these large effects if numbers of study sites and years were reduced to typical levels in landscape pest‚Äêcontrol studies. Our results suggest increasing landscape complexity may mitigate pest populations and insecticide applications. Habitat conservation represents an economically and environmentally sound approach for achieving sustainable grape production.",1607917251

Abstract: Policy proposals to address predation of wildlife by domestic cats (Felis catus) include reducing cat populations, regulating ownership, educating owners, and restricting cats‚Äô outdoor access. Such proposals rarely account for cat owners‚Äô perspectives, however, and are frequently met with strong, principled opposition. We conducted a Q‚Äêmethodological study to investigate the views of domestic cat owners in the UK on the roaming and hunting behaviors of their pets. We identified five distinctive cat‚Äêowner perspectives: (1) Concerned Protectors focus on cat safety, (2) Freedom Defenders prioritize cat independence and oppose restrictions on behavior, (3) Tolerant Guardians believe outdoor access is important for cats but dislike their hunting, (4) Conscientious Caretakers feel some responsibility for managing their cats‚Äô hunting, and (5) Laissez‚Äêfaire Landlords were largely unaware of the issues surrounding roaming and hunting behavior. Most participants valued outdoor access for cats and opposed confinement to prevent hunting; cat confinement policies are therefore unlikely to find support among owners in the UK. To address this conservation challenge, we argue that generic policies will be less effective than multidimensional strategies offering owners practical husbandry approaches that are compatible with their diverse circumstances, capabilities, and senses of responsibility.",1607310328

39,ecology,GIS certification after M.S.?,"The pandemic has given me a lot of time to figure out what I want to do after my current job as a research tech, which I expect to run out of funding at the end of 2021. I have decided to focus more on jobs that are centered around landscape/spatial ecology, so I'm figuring out what additional education I need.

Some basic information about me: I have an M.S. in microbial ecology. My favorite parts of my project were the data analysis, graph making, and the one GIS class I took to help me flesh out the details about the land use surrounding our study areas. One of the maps I made ended up in one of our publications, and I'm still pretty proud of it. I was also good at finding interesting primary literature. I like thinking about how all the parts of an ecosystem work together, both biotic and abiotic. I'm pretty comfortable with and enjoy using R, and from what I've seen of Python, I think I could figure it out quickly. I've also toyed with some web development. In my free time, I play a lot of computer games, many of which are city builders that require figuring out and planning how different moving parts are going to interact and influence each other, even across long distances.

What I'm looking for: I would like a job where most of my time is spent on environmental/ecological GIS, mixed with other forms of data analysis and visualization as needed. I understand that it will include some mindless data entry and such, especially in entry level jobs. I'm not aiming to become a primary investigator, so I'm assuming a PhD would be unnecessary.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Since I already have my M.S. in a type of ecology, would a certification be enough to do what I'm interested in? I feel like a lot of the interesting projects I've seen are looking for post docs instead. Also, would it be reasonable to finish a 15 credit certification within a year?
2. Are there actually GIS jobs in ecology out there at the level I'm looking for? Overall it sounds like there are lots of GIS jobs in general, but I've seen some comments saying that GIS jobs within ecology/sustainability are still pretty competitive because everybody wants to help with climate change. And are there particular words I should be searching for, like analyst instead of technician? Maybe I'll have to do a non-ecology job for a while to build up experience?
3. Are there any good work from home positions? At this point I know that I do my best data analysis when I'm by myself, and I also don't want to have to move again if possible.
4. What types of places should I be looking at for jobs? Universities probably? Research institutes? Something else?",1607174128

55,ecology,Iceland reinvents itself,"Akureyri is a city located in Iceland from which you can get a series of ideas to change the way some of us we take care of the planet. It has a population of 18,000 people and an innovative educational system focused on creating a better world thanks to its university. Iceland is known for its low emissions generated from homes, however, it had very high figures from residual emissions from consumption, especially in the transport sector. A decade ago, they established environmental policies that have made this city one of the most sustainable places on the planet. They reached this level after analyzing the residual materials that circulated through the city and tried to reintroduce them into a new sustainable system. With these studies and strategies, they were able to use waste materials for new purposes.

It is well-known that some countries have more ecological electric public transport systems than those powered by gasoline. However, you should know that in Iceland they have opted for used cooking oil to move public transport. Exactly the one you just fried the potatoes with. The transportation system is public and free for all inhabitants, which is a fundamental aspect of daily life in that country. This new system allows organic waste to biodegrade and the remaining nutrients can be used in agricultural activity. In this way, no artificial products that harm the environment are used. This town has helped reduce gas emissions that aggravate the greenhouse effect. Likewise, it has used resources for information campaigns on plastic pollutants and has managed to significantly reduce its use. Akureyri is a world reference that leads the environmental system in Iceland. We could think that a medium-sized city so geographically distant from the most polluting epicenters on the planet does not contribute significantly to carbon fluxes and does not impact climate change. However, their contribution is valuable and measurable, as well as innovative and influential in creating a cleaner world.",1606870651

Some of these challenges include potentially existential threats including but not limited to those facing our food and water supplies and the rapid rate of biodiversity losses.

So my question then is this: how do we make the general public more aware of the fuller spectrum of the daunting ecological challenges that our planet is facing?

Some of the ideas that come to mind might include:

* Creating a general pool of funds from multiple NGOs and non-profits to create a commercial or documentary introducing people to the littany of charges against the industrial economy and consumerism.
* Pushing for ecology and environmental science to be considered as mandatory educational courses.
* Finding ways to bring the bright minds currently involved in things like AI, robotics, and space terraforming into the camp of planet preservation and restoration. 
* Funding the production of movies and games to help bring popular science fiction out of the bleak realm of the multitude of dystopian visions that currently capture people's imaginations.
* Finding ways to counter-balance the propaganda that is commercial branding and advertising.
* Addressing the challenges posed by some of the scientific conflicts of interest that come from industry sponsored research.

It just seems like until the general public is made more aware of the multitude of challenges that we're up against they simply won't change their lifestyles. This is especially relevant to the more economically prosperous nations but it might also convince other countries that some of the so called progress that they hope to emulate is in fact a catastrophe in the making and that they might be better of playing technological leap frog and moving directly toward more sustainable systems. I'd love to hear other people's feedback, especially other ideas for solutions, suggestions for the challenges and solutions that would be most relevant for the general public to be made aware of, or if you simply disagree with any of this.",1606764479

Abstract: Several findings suggest that CO2 emissions in lakes are not always directly linked to changes in metabolism but can be associated with interactions with the dissolved inorganic carbon equilibrium. Alkalinity has been described as a determining factor in regulating the relative contributions of biological and inorganic processes to carbon dynamics in lakes. Here we analyzed the relationship between metabolic changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) at different timescales in eight lakes covering a wide range in alkalinity. We used high-frequency data from automatic monitoring stations to explore the sensitivity of DIC to metabolic changes inferred from oxygen. To overcome the problem of noisy data, commonly found in high-frequency measurements datasets, we used Singular Spectrum Analysis to enhance the diel signal-to-noise ratio. Our results suggest that in most of the studied lakes, a large part of the measured variability in DO and DIC reflects non-metabolic processes. Furthermore, at low alkalinity, DIC dynamics appear to be mostly driven by aquatic metabolism, but this relationship weakens with increasing alkalinity. The observed deviations from the metabolic 1:1 stoichiometry between DO and DIC were strongly correlated with the deviations expected to occur from calcite precipitation, with a stronger correlation when accounting also for the benthic contribution of calcite precipitation. This highlights the role of calcite precipitation as an important driver of CO2 supersaturation in lakes with alkalinity above 1 meq L‚àí1, which represents 57% of the global area of lakes and reservoirs around the world.",1606710596

75,ecology,Best way to approach talking to professors or other career ecologist?,"Hello all,

I have worked in the field since 2014 and am currently looking to get into a masters program or if I get lucky enough to find a full time career.  With my diversity of work and graduating with a BS in Evolutionary biology/ecology I feel I'm a decent fit in a lot of programs. Some of the various work I have done includes: AIM work, spotted owl surveys, invasive plant mitigation, prarie dog work, rare wildlife/plant surveys, R coding, macro invertebrate sorting, and in college worked in a lab that sent biological experiments to space, and many other professional experiences. This is all for varying agencies from government work to private contracts.

That being said, the most difficult thing for me is contacting ""random"" people in the field. It is hard for me to figure out how to open up a dialogue, say with a professor or career ecologist, to help figure out the next step on the path to finding a full-time career myself. What are some ways people have approached this or if there are any career ecologist or professors reading this, is there a particular way you like to be contacted?

93,ecology,Stumped on next steps,"I am running a discrete choice habitat preference model to analyze drivers of endangered fish species location preferences as a function of streamflow, functional redundancy afforded by other native species and predation by invasive species. These are three variables. For the first variable, I collaborated with a hydrologist who plotted streamflow curves for the locations from my dataset. They will be the first characteristic variable. The dependent variable + the second and third independent variables have me stuck. 

Because of the huge variance in number of sampling days over time in the dataset, I had to standardize the fish dataset. But I'm stumped in terms of plugging them in the final model. I have three categories - endangered (dependent variable with 4 species listed), other native (14 species) and invasive (8 species). So, my question is, is there a summarizing variable that would lump together fishes in the same category? For e.g. standardized fish values for location A in year 1991 is as follows: 

Location A    Fish 1.   Fish 2.   Fish 3.    Fish 4 

2.97.     5.15.         0.1        0.  

Fish 1-4 are all in the endangered category. Not being an ecologist I had envisioned doing a Shannon-Weiner on each category before plugging them in the model. However, I hadn't realized I may not be able to do that with standardized values, but would need the actual abundances, but this defeats the purpose of standardization. How could a single defining value be derived from the above numbers to plug into the model: endangered fish (1-4) == Fn (Beta0 + streamflow + native fish (5-18) + invasive fish (19-26))? 

I cannot take each fish individually because the equation model would become unnecessarily complicated. Thoughts/suggestions?",1606266171

Abstract:     Plant growth is normally constrained by nutrients, water or temperature, not photosynthesis, and plants often have surplus carbohydrates.
    Secondary metabolites are produced in N-limited plants primarily to dispose of surplus carbon, although they may subsequently help reduce browsing damage.
    Surplus carbohydrates are translocated from leaves and below ground some are discharged via exudates and mycorrhizal fungi.
    Root exudates contain more of the elements that plants have in surplus, and less of those in short supply.
    The abundance and type of mycorrhizal fungi is influenced by the amount and composition of surplus carbon in roots.
    Surplus carbon provides an alternative lens though which to view interactions between plants and soil organisms.

Plant growth is usually constrained by the availability of nutrients, water, or temperature, rather than photosynthetic carbon (C) fixation. Under these conditions leaf growth is curtailed more than C fixation, and the surplus photosynthates are exported from the leaf. In plants limited by nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P), photosynthates are converted into sugars and secondary metabolites. Some surplus C is translocated to roots and released as root exudates or transferred to root-associated microorganisms. Surplus C is also produced under low moisture availability, low temperature, and high atmospheric CO2 concentrations, with similar below-ground effects. Many interactions among above- and below-ground ecosystem components can be parsi",1606104869
4,ecology,Study Design for Multi-state Multi-season Occupancy Model,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi, 

I‚Äôm wanting to design an occupancy study for a narrow range fish. We know that this fish moves from main channel areas into off-channel areas (springs, seeps, tributaries) during the spring to spawn. I want to design a multi-state multi-season occupancy model to look at the seasonal transition between these areas. I want to batch mark fish in the off-channel areas with one color of VIE tags and then batch mark the fish in the main channel with a different color VIE tag. Then try to get the extirpation (E) and colonization (C) seasonally in these habitats. 

My target species lives in shallow headwater streams that haven‚Äôt been mapped, so I don‚Äôt have every one of the off-channel areas marked. I‚Äôm having trouble figuring out how to randomly select my sites to include both main channel and off-channel habitat. How can I randomly select these habitats? And If I find a way to randomly select the sites that include both types of habitat, can I use main channel and off-channel as ‚Äústates‚Äù for my model? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!",1606083924

I know there were multiple human species and sapiens are the only ones left. That seems to suggest high intellect just isn't worth its cost.

How did you decide what to switch to, and how did you do it?","Basically, I've had a career at least somewhat related to ecology for 7 years now, and I'm frustrated with the limited career opportunities and growth available in this field. In my 7 years, I've gone through 4 full-time jobs and 1 part-time. I've done research, worked in environmental education and outreach, worked as an environmental consultant, and most recently in a regulatory capacity for a local government. I also have interned at a non profit, and have a masters degree.

In every position, I've found myself either enjoying the work, but it's a dead end job with no opportunity for growth. Or, the work is 12 hrs+/day consulting work that requires you to do overnight travel week after week. In every job, I've found myself quitting a year or 2 in for one of these reasons and jumping to something else, only to run into the same frustrations. It's not for lack of performance either. I've worked my butt off and received stellar reviews from all my managers, but I just don't enjoy it anymore.

I live in the southeast US, and in general, research and nonprofit positions at my level pay crap. State government positions pay crap. Local government is hit or miss, and I'm OK where I'm at for now, but there is no room for growth in the organization. Consulting jobs are aplenty but generally involve a terrible work life balance, in addition to low pay in many cases. In addition, since getting to experience WFH during Covid, I've really enjoyed having the option, and am frustrated that most employers in this field still expect you to come to an office even on days you're just doing paperwork, whereas I'm seeing other industries adapt with the times.

So my question to you all is, has anyone else who's experienced similar frustrations been able to make a career switch? What caused it, and how did you do it? Any careers which would be less of a difficult transition having a background in ecology?",1605790238

39,ecology,"Jobs in microbial ecology, wetland ecology, nutrient cycling","Hi everyone,

Currently I am getting my masters degree in conservation/restoration ecology (2-year degree, research program) in the Netherlands. I am thinking a lot about what is out there after I finish with this degree, and as such have been reading upon people's experineces online. However, I notice a lot of experiences in the field of ecology are focused on wildlife conservation, which is something I am not interested in at all (this sounds bad when I type it, but it's just not my specialisation). Rather, I am really interested in nutrient cyling, microbiology and wetlands. I also find nature-inclusive agriculture very interesting. 

I do now that I won't ever want a job that forces me into an office 4/5 days a week. I really need some variation in my workdays (I am doing an internship right now, and I noticed I really liked the variation labwork, fieldwork and literature research). 

Any of you that work within the specialized fields I mentioned? I would be really interested in your experiences. Additionally, I am interested in whether there are opportunities for me to work outside of Europe in these fields and whether my degree is valued there. Many of my peers continue with a PhD, which makes you a paid employee of the university in the Netherlands (you're not considered a student). I've also been thinking about (if possible) doing a PhD at Wageningen University following my masters, since this institution is well-respected in the field of nature-inclusive agriculture and ecology.

Sometimes I feel like I have too many interests that are too far apart, I feel kind of like I'm drifting and directionless in my degree and I'm scared I won't be able to specialize myself well into a specific topic.",1605782055

Then, explain with the help of the picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds are connected to each other. Using the picture, I should also be able to explain the carbon cycle. [Here's the image I took](https://imgur.com/a/xIdFovM), and below you will find my answer. Please help me by sharing your thoughts on how I should restructure my text, or if I should elaborate somewhere, etc. thank you in advance:

&gt;Organic compounds consist of molecules that have a carbon skeleton, that is, it has a chain of carbon atoms that form the basis of an organic molecule. Organic substances are high in energy, and some of them are used as fuels, e.g. substances contained in petrol. The molecules consist of carbon and hydrogen, and when these are combusted, during the formation of carbon dioxide, we have a reaction between the carbon atoms and oxygen. The hydrogen atoms in the molecules can also react with oxygen during combustion, and from this, water molecules are formed. Plants are made up of organic substances, and when they burn, carbon dioxide and water vapour are formed. The energy in these is converted into heat and light energy. Humans, and other living things, also consist of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order for the carbon atoms not to run out in nature, they must be reusable, which is why we have something called the carbon cycle. The cycle contains molecules from carbon dioxide and glucose. Plants can form glucose through photosynthesis, and the carbon atoms needed for glucose are derived from the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere (air), which is an extremely small proportion, 0.039%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to carbon dioxide, plants need water and energy to produce glucose. The plants convert light energy from the sun, or lamps, in the green substance called chlorophyll, which is found in the leaves of plants, where light energy is collected. During photosynthesis, oxygen is formed, in addition to glucose, and released to the environment. The reaction of photosynthesis can most easily be described according to this formula:   
&gt;  
&gt;light energy + carbon dioxide + water ‚ü∂ glucose + oxygen.   
&gt;  
&gt;Six carbon molecules, and water molecules, together with light energy, gives us an excess of oxygen atoms, which is why oxygen is formed. Thus, the oxygen present in the atmosphere of the planet is formed by photosynthesis. At the same time as photosynthesis is driven by light energy, the energy released during cellular respiration is of a corresponding amount, and is converted into heat, which is then radiated from organisms. Energy has no reuse in a cycle like carbon, because it is radiated from organisms into space. This means that the sun has a great impact on the life that exists on our earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Glucose is classified as simple sugars, monosaccharides, from which we can derive much of our energy. Humans get glucose, and other energy-rich nutrients, with the food that are eaten. Animals, as well as plants, go through a process called cellular respiration where glucose is used as fuel, and where carbon dioxide and water are formed. This is how carbon dioxide comes back into the atmosphere.   
&gt;  
&gt;Organic substances found in dead plants and animals are decomposed by decomposers (e.g. fungi and bacteria). But even decomposers have cellular respiration that helps the air get back carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that plants, and animals, that die in cold climates, or where the environment is anaerobic, which makes it difficult for decomposers to break down decayed animals and plants. These plants and animal residues can be stored for a long time without being completely degraded. Over time, they are processed to become coal, oil, or natural gas, i.e. fossil fuels, which were stored in the ground for millions of years. When we burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the air, and so the cycle continues.

Abstract: The recent widespread expansion of deciduous shrubs across much of the Arctic has been largely attributed to climate warming. This study investigated decadal growth rates of dwarf birch (*Betula glandulosa*) across a low Arctic landscape in the continental interior of Canada. Detailed birch cover (100 m2 replicate plots) and individual shrub stature measurement datasets for five representative habitat-types were compared between 2006 and 2016, and evaluated in relation to environmental characteristics. Furthermore, dendrochronologically-based annual growth rates were assessed in relation to the 20-year climate record. Birch height, lateral dimensions, and patch groundcover all increased 20‚Äì25% relative to 2006 values, but these increases were similar among the habitat-types. Together, the limited evidence of recent warming at this site, the absence of significant habitat-type growth rate differences, and the lack of correlation between annual climate and stem secondary growth strongly suggest that climate change was not the principal cause. Instead, we propose that release from caribou impacts following the recent severe herd decline may explain the net shrub growth. Individual shrub growth rates were correlated with soil nutrient availability, but the latter was highly variable, suggesting that growth rates are primarily determined by fine-scale rather than habitat-scale spatial heterogeneity in nutrient supply. Together, our results demonstrate that birch growth has been enhanced across a variety of habitat-types in the Daring Lake landscape over the decade since 2006, and suggest that the recent severe caribou herd declines may be at least as significant as climate warming in driving birch shrub expansion in the Canadian central low Arctic.",1605500913

83,ecology,Looking for some outside perspective on deciding between 2 MS programs,"Hi everyone.

I‚Äôm trying to decide between 2 MS programs and I‚Äôm really stuck on the decision. I‚Äôm thinking that maybe some people further along in the world of academia or research in this field might be able to help me weight what is important here.

A bit of background, I‚Äôm planning to do a PhD afterwards. One program (well call it A) is essentially entirely in my area of focus of what I‚Äôd love to specialize on. The other program is very adjacent with many transferable skills, but would also offer me the chance to broaden my horizons and increase my latitude of future possibilities while still offering me skill development in the area of my primary focus.

Essentially, the decision comes down to this:

Option A is entirely within my primary area of focus. It‚Äôll allow me to get deeper into this area, and hit the ground running if I indeed do continue to PhD in this, but also possibly may mildly shoehorn me into this subfield. I already have a relationship with the advisor for option A. I also really like the location.

Option B would allow me to do a pretty strong skill development based program in an area adjacent to my main academic focus, along with some international travel and what seems to be a really cool overall experience, with a cool strong cohort based model, which I would like the experience of. I think that afterwards I would return to the subject that is in option A, which while giving me some useful skills for, option B wouldn‚Äôt be as entirely focused in that subfield. Mainly I think that this would be a really interesting 2 year diversion before diving back into my main area, which I would like to do afterwards as a PhD and probably even in the same region as I‚Äôm considering for option A.

Hard to describe all the factors going into this, but I‚Äôll just sum up the overall conflict here and pitch it to you all with the following sentence:

Would you advise spending an extra 2 years for an MS exactly within the subject that you likely will do a PhD in, or do you think it‚Äôs better to use that time to get some diversity and interesting experiences which will ultimately contribute skill sets towards that subject, but not as directly?

Sorry if this is poorly phrased or not enough info. Just looking to get anyone‚Äôs outside perspective because the decision paralysis is gonna wreck me with going back and forth over the next few months before I make the ultimate choice, lol.

84,ecology,How do forests and rainforest capture CO2 and keep it longterm?,"I don't really understand this. I am sorry if the question is basic.

&amp;#x200B;

When a tree grows, it uses CO2 as a building materialal. In this way, it captures this CO2. But, trees are not that long lived. When it dies, and rots, this CO2 is released into the atmosphere?

&amp;#x200B;

Should this not mean that forests are only effective at sequestering CO2 while the total amount of their biomass is increasing?

So if we cut a certain amount, and plant the same amount, we have done nothing?

E.g., if we take down a 100-year-old Oak, we must plant at least two in it's place and put an embargo on their cutting down for the next 100 years?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, if this is true, does this mean, by necessity, that this can only work in combination with intensive/GMO farming, as we could be using less land for crops, and forest the rest?

We're a few months in now, so I felt some of you maybe interested to learn more about the project.  So far we've built an image capture system, collected footage and created a surveying web application. Over winter we will be developing the models we hope to use for identifying species such as Japanese Knotweed, Himalayan Balsam as well as Ash (not invasive but of concern due to Ash dieback).

Abstract: Predicting the response of biological communities to changes in the environment or management is a fundamental pursuit of community ecology. Meeting this challenge requires the integration of multiple processes: habitat filtering, niche differentiation, biotic interactions, competitive exclusion, and stochastic demographic events. Most approaches to this long‚Äêstanding problem focus either on the role of the environment, using trait‚Äêbased filtering approaches, or on quantifying biotic interactions with process‚Äêbased community dynamics models. We introduce a novel approach that uses functional traits to parameterize a process‚Äêbased model. By combining the two approaches we make use of the extensive literature on traits and community filtering as a convenient means of reducing the parameterization requirements of a complex population dynamics model whilst retaining the power to capture the processes underlying community assembly. Using arable weed communities as a case study, we demonstrate that this approach results in predictions that show realistic distributions of traits and that trait selection predicted by our simulations is consistent with in‚Äêfield observations. We demonstrate that trait‚Äêbased filtering approaches can be combined with process‚Äêbased models to derive the emergent distribution of traits. While initially developed to predict the impact of crop management on functional shifts in weed communities, our approach has the potential to be applied to other annual plant communities if the generality of relationships between traits and model parameters can be confirmed.",1604891044

In September, Russian surfers raised an alarm over contamination at  Avacha Bay, Kamchatka region, which is in Russia‚Äôs Far East. People  reported suspicious water color, smell and yellow foam, which covered  the surface of the water. The geographer and administrator of Snowave  Kamchatka surf school Ekaterina Dyba commented: *‚ÄúPure water of  Khalaktyrskiy Beach has become unsafe for people and, more likely, for  marine life. During several weeks after contacted the water, all surfers  have been suffering of eye pain. Blurry vision, vision worsening, dry  eye syndrome. Sore throat. Many suffered from nausea, muscular weakness,  fever. We rang alarm a couple of days ago, because the symptoms  remained day to day.‚Äù* She added that the water analysis has shown  petroleum products and carbolic acid were above the norm 4 and 2 times  respectively. Local citizens posted photos of dead marine animals ‚Äì  crabs, seals, urchins, octopuses, clams washed ashore by the sea.

Ecologists and activists raise a question: how did this happen?

Initially, three possible versions of the incident were considered.  It was supposed that a seismic activity in the area could be a reason of  contamination ‚Äì about 160 volcanoes are located at Kamchatka Peninsula,  many of them are active. However, the allegation was denied by  seismologists; Russian authorities, not willing the information about  the incident to be widely transmitted, keep defending this version.

Another version suggests that the death of marine life was caused by  abnormal algae bloom. But the allegation is questioned by Greenpeace,  yet, it has been also investigated. Greenpeace activists suppose that  contamination was caused by the leak of chemicals from Russian military  sites, situated near Avacha Bay.

The version was confirmed by the conclusions of the members of the  Faculty of Chemistry of Lomonosov Moscow State University ‚Äì probes of  the water from Avacha Bay have shown highly toxic degradation products  of the rocket fuel ‚Äòheptyl‚Äô. Moscow ecologist Georgiy Kavanosan stated  that the water tests, made in two different ways, have shown  n-nitrosodimethylamine and tetramethyl-2-tetrazene which are the  degradation products of heptyl which allows to claim that heptyl was the  initial product. The expert supposes that the cause for these toxic  substances to appear in the ocean was industrial only. It is highly  likely that they were spilled into the ocean ‚Äî and triggered the ‚Äòred  tides‚Äô ‚Äì via groundwater near Radygino military site (where since 90s  300 tons of the rocket fuel is kept) or from Russian military site in  the city of Vilyuchinsk.

The incident of such a kind has happened in 2015. The symptoms of  poisoning were the same: chemical burn of cornea, the injury of nervous  and respiratory systems, a loss of consciousness, vomit, etc.

However, the rocket fuel is not the only possible chemical pollutant.  Kamchatka governor Vladimir Solodov supposes that Kozelsky site, where  the pesticides are stored deep in the ground, is no more appropriate for  the use in agriculture and can be the dangerous source of  contamination. The site was built and exploited in the Soviet era, in  1979-1981, later the facility was conserved. Despite the regulative  rules, Kozelsky site was built near inhabitant area (the city of  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy), in a seismic area ‚Äì near active Kozelsky  volcano and in close proximity to the rivers which run into the ocean.  As a result, 108 tons of dangerous chemicals are kept in the ground 38  km far from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, 20 tons of them are arsenic,  others ‚Äì chemical compounds containing mercury. In 2002 it was reported  that protective membrane which isolates chemicals from the environment  collapsed and pesticides fell into the groundwater. Despite the  situation, Russian authorities have hidden the information regarding the  type and the amount of toxins which have been contaminating the water  for decades. Despite the reports made by environmental organizations,  saying that the facility requires essential maintenance to be carried  out, the problem was not resolved.

Greenpeace is not ready to draw conclusions regarding the source of  chemical contamination of Avacha Bay yet. However, it is obvious that  the consequences of human activity in the area will be sad. Ecologists  estimated that as a result of the contamination of Avacha Bay 95% of  benthos, which usually serve as food resource for marine mammals, have  died. Sea otters and harbor seals will suffer the most.

Locals and Russian activists have tried to draw the government‚Äôs  attention to environmental problems of Arctic for a long time.  Regrettably, the disaster in Avacha Bay has become one in a list of  similar incidents. For instance, this spring old reservoir in the city  of Norilsk collapsed, and 21 thousand tons of diesel fuel spilled into  the nearby Daldykan River. The water of bright red color was registered  by satellite. Nornickel, Siberian industrial giant responsible for the  catastrophe, tried to hide the fact of environmental disaster and  claimed that all fuel had been collected in time. On the contrary,  environmentalists assured that the booms were installed only 36 hours  after the spill, which caused contamination of Lake Pyasino and Kara  Sea. Officials downplayed the disaster, Nornickel contested the  accusations over the spill. And half a month later, on July 13,  Nornickel‚Äôs subsidiary Norilsktransgaz was blamed of leaking of 44 more  tons of aviation fuel. As a result, a local lake near Tukhard settlement  in Siberia was seriously polluted.

The most part of such catastrophes could have been prevented if the  Russian authorities paid attention to the reasons beforehand. For  instance, the inhabitants of the city of Baikalsk know that Lake Baikal,  a natural site in Russia protected by UNESCO, the deepest body of fresh  water is being contaminated with a waste from the nearby cellulose  factory. The factory was built in 60s, on the lake shore, in 2013 the  site was closed. During decades of non-stop operation, the facility  accumulated 6,5 million tons(!) of ash mixed with chemical compounds  resulted from the dispose of waste. Black liquid is stored in old  reservoirs built on the shore of Baikal in the open air. And, as annual  probes of the groundwater show, year by year the waste infiltrates the  lake water. A seismic activity or heavy rains can trigger one more  catastrophe, changing a landscape of Siberia forever.

While civilized countries are targeted at the reduction of negative  influence on the environment, the series of recent incidents in  Kamchatka and Siberia have demonstrated extremely non-effective Russian  environmental politics. It would be naive to suppose that the  catastrophes, reported by civil activists and ecologists, were the only  cases when Russia violated natural resources laws. Disregard of the  Russian authorities to environmental issues only confirms the fact that  the Kremlin still gives priority to generating financial profits.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the real causes of the disaster in  Kamchatka will be revealed via official media.

Abstract:     Individual differences are central in behavior, ecology, and evolution, because they determine which selective factors are relevant for an individual in interaction with its environment; yet ecological niches have rarely been studied on an individual level.
    The subset of the species‚Äô niche realized by an individual is called its individualized niche and is implemented by three major processes: choice, conformance, and construction.
    Infochemicals can differ between individuals and empower the realization of the individualized niche. Combining hormones and semiochemicals under the term infochemicals highlights their common function in information transfer within or between organisms.
    We give several examples how chemical mediators, including hormones, pheromones, and allelochemicals, are essential in the realization of an individualized niche across the animal kingdom.

Infochemicals, including hormones, pheromones, and allelochemicals, play a central role in mediating information and shaping interactions within and between individuals. Due to their high plasticity, infochemicals are predestined mediators in facilitating individualized niches of organisms. Only recently it has become clear that individual differences are essential to understand how and why individuals realize a tiny subset of the species' niche. Moreover, individual differences have a central role in both ecological adjustment and evolutionary adaptation in a rapidly changing world. Here we highlight that infochemicals act as key signals or cues and empower the realization of the individualized niche through three proposed processes: niche choice, niche conformance, and niche construction.",1603681472

81,ecology,"Ecological modeling Master's/PhD, research niche, job market questions","Hi everyone! Thank you in advance for input, applying to grad school is breaking my brain. I'll try to make my questions short and sweet

1. Majored in bio &amp; environmental science for undergrad and did senior thesis in limnology, very interested in aquatic systems. I was looking for Master's programs to apply to but stumbled upon an environmental engineer doing a project on modeling microbial processes in wetlands. He's young and his former student said good things and that he's super great at modeling. He said he may be able to fund me to do a Master's but would very like fund me if I did a PhD. I'm interested in a career doing research, whatever that means in terms of where that happens (institution, gov't, academia, etc), so this potential P.I said it might be better just to go straight into a PhD. He does applied research since he's an engineer by training whereas I have a background in more basic science research rather than applied and am not an engineer but have quite a bit of math and statistics under my belt. BUT he said we would apply to fellowships my first year and he seems pretty flexible to let me incorporate more basic research rather than super applied. Not really a question but looking for input or advice with the situation.
2. I'm interested in ecological modeling, looking at a system and perhaps focusing on investigating an aspect of the system to make a more effective model. I'm also interested in the intersection of those systems with humans and climate change, which I guess would be the intersection of ecology and anthropology. I've had a difficult time perusing journals and research to find someone who fills that niche. Part of that due to not having a ton of time to look but when I do I tend not to to find much. I tried parsing through Oceanography and Limnology, Ecological Modeling, Ecology and Evolution, any other journal recommendations? I wonder if it's okay to not necessarily find that niche yet, focus on a ecological modeling in a project that is still interesting to me, and using my time and resources in a Master's or PhD program to look for that niche rather than need to find that now? Thoughts?
3. I know it's not always easy to find ecology jobs after getting a PhD, whether it's a tenure track position or what have you. I also often see a lot of positions these days for ecological modeling. I almost wonder if it would be easier to find a job with a PhD in ecological modeling that it would be for, say, entomology?? 

Any links, advice, programs, anything is welcomed. THANK YOU!",1603658539

85,ecology,what general ecological niches can you think of that are represented in almost all ecosystems?,"What general ecological niches can you think of, that are represented in almost all ecosystems?

Ill make it short: Im creating a DnD homebrew world and I am creating a lot new environments that I have to populate with species. I had the idea that I could create a form of ‚Äûtemplate‚Äú, wich would be a list of the most common ecological niches. I then can fill them with the animals that suit my setting and so I‚Äòd have the very basics needed for an ecological environment. So far this is the list of most important ecological niches I could think of. I also included species as examples, in this case from the African savanna. 


1.low vegetation: grass

2.tall vegetation: burkea trees

3.small herbivores: Antelopes

4.small carnivores: painted dogs

5.large carnivores: Lion

6.large herbivores: Wildebeest

7.insectivores: Meerkats

8.omnivores: Warthogs

9.Scavengers: Hyenas

10.megafauna: Elephants 


Please correct me on what you think is missing or should be added. I realize that the terms are probably not scientific but I just need to understand what I mean by them. I also don‚Äôt want to specify stuff like ‚Äûflying / aquatic animal‚Äú since a lot of these niches aren‚Äôt specific to the element the creature is living in. I also chose the African savanna as a broad example, since it is the last place with true megafauna, except for oceans of course. Also, because the niches are so broad there are a lot of species that would fit for all these categories.",1603642996

He has taught us that a ""xeriscape"" is a human-created habitat designed to drain water, and requires that we recite this definition at least once per class. Under this definition, he classifies parking lots, roofs, and canal systems as ""xeriscapes."" I always learned a xeriscape was a type of landscape that uses xeric plants and requires no artificial irrigation. I can find numerous sources to back up this definition, and absolutely none that support his.

Prof. was teaching the students how to measure their paces to be able to measure a transect in the field. He put alot of emphasis on determining one's individual pace length instead of finding the number of paces per 25 or 50 ft, and when helping the students measure their paces, he instructed them to measure from the heel of one foot to the toe of the next. Due to this misinformation, he quoted students my height as having drastically different lengths-of-pace. When I asked him if it should be measured heel to heel, he became defensive and said ""lets not over complicate things.""

Later on, we were discussing answers after taking a short quiz. One of the questions went, ""True or False: Plants release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere"" He told the class that this was false, and would not budge on it even after I told him plants do release carbon dioxode through cellular respiration, they simply release alot more oxygen through photosynthesis.

His disorganization is also atrocious, but that is harder to quantify. He seems to make up assignments at random, being quite unclear about what is expected of them, and has wildly deviated from the schedule outlined in the Fall 2019 syllabus he gave us at the beginning of this (2020) semester. 

I emailed his department head and asked that the administration either put him on leave and find a substitute, or at the very least audit his class and review his lesson plans and curriculum, and she told me she couldn't really do anything because this is the first they have heard of these problems in his 15 years teaching at the university.

Abstract: 

1) Intermittent streams (IS) comprise a large proportion of the drainage network in many parts of the world. The non‚Äêflow period of IS are known to impact stream biota because aquatic habitats dry out. However, less well understood are the relative effects of the temporal component of these drying events including their duration and frequency.

2) Here, we characterised effects of temporal component of drying events on abundant and species‚Äêrich meiofauna. The effects were assessed in 22 streams in the north‚Äêeastern Iberian Peninsula. The duration and frequency of non‚Äêflow events was characterized over a period of 250 days prior to sampling the sediment‚Äêdwelling meiofauna in riffle zones that completely dried out.

3) Overall, meiofauna abundances were amongst the highest ever reported for streambeds. Most meiofaunal taxa correlated positively with the frequency of drying events and correlated positively with the length of dry periods recorded shortly before sampling, suggesting that the community was able to recover quickly. Tardigrades were the only group to correlate positively with the longest dry periods, suggesting that they had the best resilience capabilities in streams that had experienced the longest droughts.

4) On average, nematodes made up half of the meiofauna. We identified a total of 113 different nematode species. The nematode community was more taxonomically diverse in IS, with a smaller proportion of bacterivores and a higher proportion of fungivore species such as Filenchus vulgaris. Thereby resembling the trophic structure commonly observed in soil ecosystems.

5) Our results show that most meiofauna were positively influenced by drying disturbance, that is being able to quickly recover after them. This suggests outstanding resilience capabilities, and points out meiofaunal organisms as key players for kick‚Äêstarting stream food webs and functions once flow returns.",1603047211

Abstract: Logging has depleted timber resources across a considerable portion of the world's tropical forests, leaving them vulnerable to conversion to other land‚Äêuse types. This raises the question of whether management for restoration represents an economically viable alternative. We reviewed restoration concessions (areas of degraded state forest land leased to enterprises on long‚Äêterm [‚â•60‚Äêyear] licenses for restoration‚Äêcompatible business development) in Indonesia since their introduction in 2004 and found that, although many opportunities and actions are being explored, business models remain largely aspirational. Costs ‚Äì including those associated with taxes and reporting, forest protection, community development, and restoration interventions ‚Äì are high, while developing revenues at sufficient scale from carbon markets, non‚Äêtimber forest products, and ecosystem services is challenging. Potential solutions include the development of restoration‚Äêcompatible revenue streams and value‚Äêadded processing to generate income, investment in communities to bring them in as partners in restoration enterprises, and creation of a supportive regulatory environment by reducing statutory costs and eliminating perverse regulations. Restoration concessions are a scalable policy option for promoting private investment in restoration that could be replicated internationally to help meet ambitious global restoration targets.",1602471106

So some people want nutella to replace palm oil with some other kind of oil because palm oil is harming the environment by means of deforestation because of palm tree crops.

So if nutella use an other kind of vegetal oil it would actually require more surface to farm the stuff that produces it and thus it would harm the environment even more?

REAL CLIMATE JUSTICE = 100% PRIVATE GLOBAL CARBON UBI = 0% FOR GOVERNMENTS

The key to effective private dividends is a monthly rebate deposit to citizens.

Private dividends were first proposed by James Hansen and several economists 10 years ago

27 Nobel Prize winning economists support Hansen's dividends, including:

3,589 U.S. Economists,

4 Former Chairs of the Federal Reserve and

ALL 15 Former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers

We can‚Äôt build wildfire suppression big enough to handle future wildfires

Forest fires will burn faster than we can plant trees

We  burn recycled plastic and paper for electricity

Plastic harms the plankton that produce 10% of earth's oxygen

In the last 20 years, petrochemical demand grew 7X human population

We don‚Äôt have enough land for bio-energy and carbon capture, we're losing soil and water too fast

To get 30% of energy from algae would take a country the size of Argentina

To get 20% of global energy from solar in 30 years, we need panels 3X faster than now

By 2050, there will 78 million metric tons of solar panel waste, generating 6 million metric tons of new solar panel waste annually

Standard electronics recycling methods don‚Äôt cut it for solar panels ( Wired )

I was originally planning on applying to masters programs this year in fish and wildlife biology or conservation biology or something related. But with the pandemic, I think it would be best to wait on grad school. Since no one really knows when this will be over I've been looking into a graduate certificate in environmental policy in hopes I can get a better job in the meantime or boost my grad school resume (most jobs I'm looking at want some sort of knowledge in policy). My question is, would a grad certificate be worth it in this area? Do employers even care about graduate certificates? should I just wait another year or so for a Masters? I only ever really see advice for business degrees or engineering, so I would really appreciate it if anyone has experience in graduate certificates or working in Environmental Science/Ecology/Wildlife Biology etc.

If you ask between a petrol/gas car vs a electric car, which one will bring natural catastrophe faster, sooner to this civilization, then my answer is electric car !  
 

The science and theory say that: CO2 cause global warming, cause ice melting and to root problem of the ‚Äúfuture nature mega disaster‚Äù.  
 It sound very logical because when you burn fire near ice, it will melt, if you burn woods in your house,you will get warmer, so CO2 is the problem.  
 

Hey what if metals, technology (including everything made in lab house) is the direct cause of Climate Change.  
 

Why don‚Äôt you ask why and how metals go rust?  
 It is because of air, fire, water.  
 

So the more metals, technology stuffs on the surface, the more natural catastrophe disaster come to you.  
 

The theory CO2 only maybe ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù about ice melting, but what about storm,earthquake, tsunami, volcano eruption which was happened many timesin the past?  
 

Use your common sense and pick the correct theory.  
 **CO2** vs **Metals, Technology**.  
 One theory only ‚Äúmaybe correct‚Äù about 1 catastrophe event.  
 But other theory satisfy all the natural catastrophe events.  
 

If you ask why the metals on the surface go rust then it is the ‚Äúunripe product‚Äù.  
 A small little air can do it, so with high amount of quantity require a lot of air (storm, tsunami, floods).  
 

Why it melting? Then the answer it is because it is not the ‚Äúoriginal products/materials of life on Earth‚Äù, simply like that.  
 

Most of word leaders are digging the grave for this entire civilization by gambling on the wrong CO2 theory.  
 

Technology, science cannot predict the right temperature, when rain come, what wind direction, and cannot know the secret of life exist  beyond human eyes and any kind of technology.  
 

Go ask yourself, your friends and compare both theories above and make your own conclusion about climate change global warming subject.

## Abstract

Changing climate can modify predator‚Äìprey interactions and induce declines or local extinctions of species due to reductions in food availability. Species hoarding perishable food for overwinter survival, like predators, are predicted to be particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures. We analysed the influence of autumn and winter weather, and abundance of main prey (voles), on the food‚Äêhoarding behaviour of a generalist predator, the Eurasian pygmy owl (*Glaucidium passerinum*), across 16¬†years in Finland. Fewer freeze‚Äìthaw events in early autumn delayed the initiation of food hoarding. Pygmy owls consumed more hoarded food with more frequent freeze‚Äìthaw events and deeper snow cover in autumn and in winter, and lower precipitation in winter. In autumn, the rotting of food hoards increased with precipitation. Hoards already present in early autumn were much more likely to rot than the ones initiated in late autumn. Rotten food hoards were used more in years of low food abundance than in years of high food abundance. Having rotten food hoards in autumn resulted in a lower future recapture probability of female owls. These results indicate that pygmy owls might be partly able to adapt to climate change by delaying food hoarding, but changes in the snow cover, precipitation and frequency of freeze‚Äìthaw events might impair their foraging and ultimately decrease local overwinter survival. Long‚Äêterm trends and future predictions, therefore, suggest that impacts of climate change on wintering food‚Äêhoarding species could be substantial, because their ‚Äòfreezers‚Äô may no longer work properly. Altered usability and poorer quality of hoarded food may further modify the foraging needs of food‚Äêhoarding predators and thus their overall predation pressure on prey species. This raises concerns about the impacts of climate change on boreal food webs, in which ecological interactions have evolved under cold winter conditions.",1598596438

Background: I got my degree in Biology and have a concentration in environmental science. I figured the course I'd take (plant systematics, plant physiology, field botany, field microbiology) would provide me enough book knowledge for entry level into the world of botany but by the end of schooling realized I think I love the interactions of plants with their environment way more (both my undergrad research projects delt with these interactions) and I only took intro ecology and intro zoology. 

Pretty much every job I've applied to at the entry level has required some experience in assessment, regulations/permitting and delineation. These are topics we covered in class (and did a single lab on delineation and two on assessments) but I lack experience in them. All my volunteer experience past and present (well over a decades worth) has more to do with cleaning up the environment, planting trees, stocking streams, etc (I did help with construction of a riprap for stream management) but this isn't apprently enough  to make up for no experience in assessments, regulations, or delineations.

94,ecology,Grad School Opportunity - Need Advice,"Hey guys,

I have an opportunity to get a MS in natural resources from UW-stevens point and participate in soil organic carbon research. I would be working with the NRCS and farmers/foresters/etc to develop a multi-faceted toolkit for the state of WI to determine soil carbon in the field. We would be assisting with developing provisional ecological site descriptions for the NRCS throughout the state of WI. We would be teaching farmers and NRCS scientists how to use this toolkit at the end of the research project. There are also opportunities to hybridize my curriculum with wetland science/restoration courses - which is where my primary interests lie. The problem is that the next two years of funding have NOT dispersed yet, and yet the professor is looking for someone to get started on the project this fall (so VERY soon), which I don't know if I feel comfortable with that. 

I think I could enjoy a really enjoy a career with the NRCS or a soil/water conservation society if I go down that road. I know I have a big interest in agriculture but I do want to make sure that a graduate degree specializing in soil science will give me the ability to work in higher roles in restoration (wetland specialist, conservation/restoration planner, etc) as this is where the core of my passion lies. My ideal job would to be to work as a regulator/scientist in wetland mgmt/restoration and to marry my nature/landscape photography that I capture while in the field as a side business to it. If I could also use my free time to start up a small native plant nursery and sell plants/seed mix this would be the most ideal way for me to make a difference, fuel my creativity/intellectual capacity and make a comfortable income.

What do you guys think of my ideas and goals with all of this being said? Can a person specializing in soil science offer their skills to restoration ecology and wetland science to a great extent? What about funding - is it a big risk to go move and start taking classes if there isn't a confirmation the USDA/NRCS grant has not been dispersed yet?

This wood will rot and sooner or later it will re-release the CO2 into air. Either by decay in 100 years, or instantly when fire happens.

Why are not we planting the trees and after they mature/die, we dont cut them and throw them to oil wells to keep CO2 balanced as was in the past?

Why everybody is focusing on planting of trees and nobody looks at overall balance. These trees needs to go under as fast as oil goes above ground.

Last year, we pumped 6km^3 of oil above ground. We returned to ground 0 wood. Its on the surface releasing CO2 slowly back.

If we plant trillions of trees, we just capture current CO2 in the air and as soon as it starts to burn, it will be rereleased to air. Planting trees alone doesnt make any sense. We need to landfill them to make a difference.",1598268022

Abstract: Herbivory has potential to modify vegetation responses to climatic changes. However, climate and herbivory also affect each other and rarely work in isolation from other ecological factors, such as plant‚Äêplant competition. Thus, it is challenging to predict the extent to which herbivory can counteract, amplify or interact with climate impacts on ecosystems. Here, we investigate how moose modify climatic responses of boreal trees by using experimental exclosures on two continents and modeling complex causal pathways including several climatic factors, multiple tree species, competition, tree height, time, food availability, and herbivore presence, density and browsing intensity. We show that moose can counteract, i.e. ‚Äúcool down‚Äù positive temperature responses of trees, but that this effect varies between species depending on moose foraging preferences. Growth of preferred deciduous trees was strongly affected by moose, whereas growth of less preferred conifers was mostly driven by climate and tree height. In addition, moose changed temperature responses of rowan in Norway and balsam fir in Canada, by making fir more responsive to temperature but decreasing the strength of the temperature response of rowan. Snow protected trees from browsing, and therefore moose ‚Äúcooling power‚Äù might increase should a warming climate result in decreased snow cover. Furthermore, we found evidence of indirect effects of moose via plant‚Äêplant competition: By constraining growth of competing trees, moose can contribute positively to the growth of other trees. Our study shows that in boreal forests, herbivory cooling power is highly context‚Äêdependent, and in order to understand its potential to prevent changes induced by warming climate, species differences, snow, competition, and climate effects on browsing need to be considered.",1598233060

11,ecology,Studies on fire ecology of the western Coast Range mountains of Oregon,"I‚Äôm writing an article for a newsletter on the historical trends of fire within this mountain range and how climate change and human activity have changed the historical burn trends.  I was hoping for clarity on if mature forests are more resilient to fire damage vs tree farms vs thinned forests within this bio region.  I have a hunch that mature forests, because there is 50% more water flow in the summer months than reprod plantations (Perry/Jones 2016), would be more resilient to fire in these Coast Range forests, but cannot find any evidence to support or deny that claim. I‚Äôm also interested in how native peoples used fire: what time of the year, which locations, etc.

One really interesting study I found (I‚Äôm on my phone and can‚Äôt remember the source) found that between the years of 1847-1849 over 1/3 of the Coast Range Forest was burned.  This was post the arrival of western settlers to the region but has not been attributed to human activity.  Prior to the arrival of western settlers, the average age of a forest before seeing fire was over 400 years in the Coast Range, so those 2 or 3 years of fire were extremely abnormal based on the composition of forest pre 1847.  Tree ring data showed those years to be drier than average, but it‚Äôs likely, based on a pattern of behavior by western settlers, they burned the forest to open land up for livestock and settlements.

Hi! 

We know that the spreading of bryophyte is really complicated and inefficient. It is mainly local because it spreads with the water flow, so the water needs to be in some slope to got up-down. 

I was wondering if turtles had a role in bryophyte spreading to a large scale all over the world (down to up, or flat land) where water cannot physically moves. We can see on many pictures that turtles (mostly and probably old) are bringing lichens and bryophytes on their shell. 

Is it some kind of key to the efficiency of genetic spreading and diversity of bryophytes?

Abstract: Understanding the drivers of geographical variation of species distributions, and of the resulting community structure, constitutes one of the grandest challenges in ecology. Geographical patterns of species richness and composition have been relatively well studied. Less is known about how the entire set of trophic and non‚Äêtrophic ecological interactions, and the complex networks that they create by gluing species together in complex communities, change across geographical extents. Here, we compiled data of species composition and three types of ecological interactions occurring between species in rocky intertidal communities across a large spatial extent (~ 970km of shoreline) of central Chile, and analysed the geographical variability in these multiplex networks (i.e. comprising several interaction types) of ecological interactions. We calculated 9 network summary statistics common across interaction types, and additional network attributes specific to each of the different types of interactions. We then investigated potential environmental drivers of this multivariate network organisation. These included variation in sea surface temperature and coastal upwelling, the main drivers of productivity in nearshore waters. Our results suggest that structural properties of multiplex ecological networks are affected by local species richness and modulated by factors influencing productivity and environmental predictability. Our results show that non‚Äêtrophic negative interactions are more sensitive to spatially structured temporal environmental variation than feeding relationships, with non‚Äêtrophic positive interactions being the least labile to it. We also show that environmental effects are partly mediated through changes in species richness and partly through direct influences on species interactions, probably associated to changes in environmental predictability and to bottom‚Äêup nutrient availability. Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive picture of ecological interactions and their geographical variability if we are to predict potential effects of environmental changes on ecological communities.",1597634902

78,ecology,Job Problems,"Will try not to go on too much of a rant here. I graduated with a BSc in Wildlife Ecology last summer, one of only four people to get a First. I then attempted to do an MSc, but decided it wasn't for me (and I didn't have the energy) so I quit in October. That waste of time was my own fault. Then I struggled to find any work since it was very quiet, ecology being as seasonal as it is, plus Covid. I also couldn't drive so I suspect that this made it worse.  I then managed to find a landscaping job and took it as I was sick of job searching. I quit after a week when I had to deal with school leaver types. It was just pure manual labour, but the director enticed me by talking about the ecological vision. It was on an HS2 site. I gave that up quickly as I didn't study ecology for five years (BSc and a diploma in countryside management) to dig holes. 

I spent the next few months applying until I finally got a consultancy job. This was good for a while, but it turns out, of course, that I chose a terrible company. It wasn't just me that thought this--most of the employees agreed. It was a recent start-up and was very independent, almost too independent. The work ethic overall was abysmal. I was on zero hour contract but because I was only one of two working in the entire south of England I had to sometimes do 2 and a half hour drives to sites on very little sleep back to back.  Did 12 hours driving in 2 days once, no exaggeration. One day involved working on a report from 9am to about 4pm then a bat survey in the evening and then an all nighter because of a dawn bat survey. Sometimes I just couldn't get sleep because of the way the schedule worked. Little communication and no guidance. My colleague, who had been working there for a year, told me he felt like he hadn't advanced at all. It was an online scheduling system, too, so there were a lot of troubles with that. Combine all of that with the fact that I don't particularly like driving, and you might be able to see why I quit. Annoying since this was my main interest job wise. 

Fast forward to today and I'm in the process of starting for a company on another HS2 site, but this one is actually about ecology. Problem is, I'm being asked to do a lot of health and safety prerequisites. I understand why this is important, but I've never really worked on a construction site before. I need to get my CSCS card, apparently, but I'm just depressed about it. Why am I being asked, on my mobile phone app, about voltages and building materials? Some of the questions have absolutely no bearing on anything I want to do. I think one was about inspecting paint on old iron work. I'm doing the Managers and Professionals one in order to get the Academically Qualified card. I'm having to pay for a health and safety course and test just to get a job...

It seems like every job I get is just a massive obstacle or has some damning aspect to it and yet most people from my course by now have had more than a year's experience by now because they managed to land simpler, more accommodating jobs. I've basically gotten nowhere in a year despite working harder than most people on my course. I got the highest grades possible in my diploma and got a First Class Honours in my degree and yet have nothing to show for it. I would've stayed with that consultancy company if they weren't so ridiculous.",1597146600

Abstract: Rapid environmental change can decouple previously reliable cues from important resources, causing specialized recognition systems to result in maladaptive behaviors. For native herbivorous insects, such evolutionary traps are often imposed by attractive invasive plants that prove harmful to their offspring. Despite the costs of ovipositing on a poor‚Äêquality host, evolutionary traps are expected to persist when overlapping cue sets (cue similarity) link decreased preference for the novel, unsuitable plant with decreased preference for the historical or native resource. We evaluated the role of cue similarity in the persistence of maladaptive oviposition by a native butterfly on a lethal, invasive mustard. While the novel plant shares glucosinolate cues with at least one of the native hosts and the most abundant cue is a strong oviposition stimulant, we found that this cue was not a major driver of preference for either plant. Nor was preference for the two plants correlated, meaning decreased preference for the invasive mustard would not cause butterflies to miss potential oviposition opportunities on the superior native host. Instead, butterfly preference was modified by previous experience in a way that suggests that frequent encounters with native hosts in the wild may buffer butterflies against this evolutionary trap.",1597029279

3,ecology,UK student looking to study ecology,"I‚Äôm going into A Levels this year and I want to make sure I‚Äôm making the right decisions for what I have roughly planned for me future.

So firstly is ecology/conservation a good course to study at uni? I do pretty well in school, I haven‚Äôt got GCSE results back but what I‚Äôm hoping for is 8/9 (A* and A**) in chemistry, biology and geography. All my other subjects are 7s or 8s. Are the course hard or easy or does it depend where you go? I want to push myself and use my ability to learn to help the greater good. 

Where is the best uni to study ecology? If you‚Äôve studied it in the UK what courses did you do and where? What were your experience?

Finally what are the jobs in the field like, my dream would be to be able to out into the world and collect data, study animals, see new places, help ecosystems and things along those lines. How realistic is this idea? What are your jobs like? 

I‚Äôm a complete newbie to this idea as I was completely clueless at what I wanted for my future but I love animals, nature, geography and biology and I felt it was a good fit.

However, this failing has given large numbers of people an excuse to reject everything else he said (you think the world is overpopulated, Hardin said that, he was a racist, do you want to agree with a racist!?). The more I investigate his other ideas, the more I agree with. In terms of ecology and the big picture, it looks to me like he was basically right about most things, and that most of the criticism of him is the result of people not wanting to face up to uncomfortable truths. If anything, his ideas are becoming more and more relevant as the consequences become visible of failing to learn the lessons he tried to teach.

It looks to me like his beliefs about race are not determined by his wider beliefs. In other words, it is possible, without inconsistency, to agree with Hardin about ecology and humanity in general, while rejecting his claims about race.

Waste disposal has long been big business but BlueCity proves that waste can sustain livelihoods and deliver environmental benefits for communities. As the Grateful Dead sang, one man gathers what another man spills.  


Based in a former Center Parcs complex, BlueCity is home to dozens of interdependent businesses all working towards closing the loop and producing a zero waste economy. One such business is¬†[@rotterzwam](https://www.instagram.com/rotterzwam/)¬†(zwam is Dutch for mushrooms), who launched in 2013 after identifying used coffee grounds as a source of waste with numerous possible applications. The British company BioBean had been founded that same year to turn waste coffee grounds into biofuel but¬†[@rotterzwam](https://www.instagram.com/rotterzwam/)¬†pursued an even more planet-friendly option by using the raw material to grow oyster mushrooms.  


Both routes produce 80% less CO‚ÇÇe emissions than sending grounds to landfill and 70% less than sending to AD (anaerobic digestion). A challenge is scaling capacity (especially after a 2017 fire stalled progress) and utilising the substrate left behind after harvest. Project lead Jente de Vries explained in 2019: ‚Äúthe problem we have encountered in our new nursery is that we can only process 6,000 kg of coffee grounds per month...Rotterdam alone incinerates 5 million kg of coffee grounds every year.‚Äù On that basis the Soil Physics and Land Management Group of Wageningen University &amp; Research (WUR) became involved last year.  


To further spread awareness and change attitudes, Rotterzwam sells spawn in Instagrammable GrowKits enabling people to become 'kitchen farmers' and use their own used coffee grounds.

Abstract: The metacommunity concept has the potential to integrate local and regional dynamics within a general community ecology framework. To this end, the concept must move beyond the discrete archetypes that have largely defined it (e.g. neutral vs. species sorting) and better incorporate local scale species interactions and coexistence mechanisms. Here, we present a fundamental reconception of the framework that explicitly links local coexistence theory to the spatial processes inherent to metacommunity theory, allowing for a continuous range of competitive community dynamics. These dynamics emerge from the three underlying processes that shape ecological communities: (1) density‚Äêindependent responses to abiotic conditions, (2) density‚Äêdependent biotic interactions and (3) dispersal. Stochasticity is incorporated in the demographic realisation of each of these processes. We formalise this framework using a simulation model that explores a wide range of competitive metacommunity dynamics by varying the strength of the underlying processes. Using this model and framework, we show how existing theories, including the traditional metacommunity archetypes, are linked by this common set of processes. We then use the model to generate new hypotheses about how the three processes combine to interactively shape diversity, functioning and stability within metacommunities.",1595821009

94,ecology,Questions about feeding urban foxes and badgers in the UK.,"So I'm an American, and here we're told never to feed wildlife. Ever. And there's some good research behind that, which I'm sure people here are familiar with. It doesn't mean that Americans always follow it- the bears in National Parks prove that. But ""don't feed wildlife!"" is everywhere, even in cities. I grew up hearing this, I heard it in high school, I heard it in college for environmental science and conservation classes, I see it on signs both urban and rural!  


I recently saw something about someone feeding a fox in their backyard garden and letting it in their house in the UK- it was on Twitter, but I think it originally came from r/relationships here. I left a response of ""Never feed animals, ever!"" and I had a bunch of Brits telling me that that it's different there, and that it's okay to feed foxes. Some were even angry with me for suggesting not to, saying that they need the extra food.  


So I dug around for research. I found nothing saying not to feed the foxes, a ton of non-profits encouraging feeding them and badgers. One non-profit had done a study supposedly, and the results were that the feeding had very little impact on the foxes' behavior and was good for them because it helped them fight off diseases through better nutrition.  


The most I found against it was ""don't feed them too much, and don't hand feed them."" There was one pest control site recommending not feeding foxes, but I figured using that as a source was a bad idea. So I went to Google Scholar and dug around there, and found nothing on the impacts of feeding urban wildlife. I saw a recent Science article about how it may be domesticating them, but the article didn't talk about the negative effects that this might have on them.  


So anyway, does anyone know more about this? Has anyone researched this? Is it really not as bad as I think? Is this even an appropriate question for this sub?",1595200030
95,ecology,Ecology grad looking for advice on finding a first job,"Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I just thought this would be a good place to start.

I recently graduated with a degree in Ecology and Evolution from a UC. I've been wanting to look for entry level jobs to get some sort of experience within Ecology, and I'm not sure exactly where to look/ what my best bets are for an entry level job.

I live in California and would preferably want to stay in California if I can (pandemic), but would be willing to move along the Pacific coast if need be. I don't have any work experience within the field, but I have a solid grasp of R (took 3 courses using R with final projects written by me), and am able to identify ~70-80% of endemic bird species by eye, and around ~60-70% of native and non native plants in CA from my field ecology lectures and labs. 

I really just want to get some hands on experience doing fieldwork, my passions are towards species counts (I love birds!) or field counts, if I could do work identifying invasive species etc. I'd love to do that as well. I'd also be willing to learn environmental consulting or do work involving river ecology as well.

I've been looking for jobs on Calcareers, and I found the Cal Conservation Corps, but I've heard lots of mixed opinions on jobs there. Besides Calcareers, where else should I look?

47,ecology,Undergrad Debating Masters vs PhD,"Hi all, I'm currently finishing up my undergrad degree in evolution and ecology this upcoming year and am starting to look into grad schools. Up until recently, my career plan was always to continue into academia, but I have been thinking more about looking into govt jobs (U.S. native) or environmental NGOs. 

I have been working in the same lab for the last two years. I am currently writing a paper on the field research I have been doing during this time as first author. Everyone I work with/for (including my PI) tells me I have essentially been doing Masters-level work as an undergrad.

I value having separation between my work and my non-work life and feel nervous about the toll the pandemic will take on the already-terrible job market.

69,ecology,Measuring ecosystem health,"Pardon the ignorant question - I'm an outsider (my education is in engineering and computer science) looking to make an impact in the world of ecology and conservation, so I'm missing many fundamentals in how the academic world of ecology works.

Are there any accepted frameworks or standards used to assess the health of a local ecosystem? I expect that this is a hard problem, given the number of combinations of direct and indirect species interactions that may exist, and the general lack of knowledge in some fundamental areas (soil, insects, etc), and agreement on what standard to compare to. For these reasons, I expect if a model/standard exists at all, it probably requires some broad generalizations.

For example (keep in mind, I'm from another field, so my example will have many flaws), in an idealized scenario you might find an untouched piece of wilderness- say, an Oak Woodland, that has most of the expected/documented species (plants, fungi, lichen, animals, etc) in a radius of X meters. You might rate the health of that area by how large of a radius you need to find 80% of common/expected species, or by what percent of expected you find in a fixed radius. Perhaps this needs to be based on a year-long survey to account for seasonal variances induced by weather (i.e. insects emerging late, birds arriving late, etc).

In this example, the metric of health could either be radius, or percent expected that were documented in a fixed radius. Of course, defining what is ""common/expected"" wouldn't be easy either, and just documenting ""found or not"" would not reflect the population size.",1593904365

Abstract:
 
**Aim**

Coral reefs shift between distinct communities with depth throughout the world. Yet, despite over half a century of research on coral reef depth gradients, researchers have not addressed the driving force of these patterns. We present a theoretical, process‚Äêbased model of light‚Äôs influence on the shallow to mesophotic reef transition as a single quantitative framework. We also share an interactive web application. Moving beyond depth as an ecological proxy will enhance research conducted on deeper coral reefs.

**Location**

Global; subtropical and tropical coral reefs, oligotrophic and turbid coastal waters.

**Time period**

Present day (2020).

**Major taxa**

Scleractinia.

**Methods**

We constructed ordinary differential equations representing the preferred light environments of shallow and mesophotic Scleractinia. We projected these as depth bands using light attenuation coefficients from around the world, and performed a sensitivity analysis.

**Results**

We found light relationships alone are sufficient to capture major ecological features across coral reef depth gradients. Our model supports the depth limits currently used in coral reef ecology, predicting a global range for the shallow‚Äêupper mesophotic boundary at 36.1 m ¬± 5.6 and the upper‚Äêlower mesophotic boundary at 61.9 m ¬± 9.6. However, our model allows researchers to move past these fixed depth limits, and quantitatively predict the depths of reef zones in locations around the world.

**Main conclusions**

The use of depth as a proxy for changes in coral reef communities offers no guidance for environmental variation between sites. We have shown it is possible to use light to predict the depth boundaries of reef zones as a continuous variable, and to accommodate this variability. Predicting the depths of reef zones in unusual light environments suggests that shallow‚Äêwater turbid reefs should be considered as mesophotic coral ecosystems. Nonetheless, the current depth‚Äêbased heuristics are relatively accurate at a global level.",1593404774

1,ecology,How do we know that saving certain endangered species is the right thing to do?,"
First off, I have only a bit more knowledge on conservation biology compared to the common person (senior undergrad biochem major), so these are genuine questions, not trying to ‚Äústump‚Äù people. Also, I just want to say I am 100% an advocate for species and climate conservation and in no way skeptical of human beings having direct and detrimental impacts on the biosphere in general. Anyways...

How do scientists even understand whether or not a species is undergoing a natural extinction, rather than the typically cited case that it‚Äôs from human involvement? 
One thought I had for this would be species undergoing rapid and unusually large loss of population over a relatively short amount of time would be a good sign that humans are involved. However, even then how could you determine whether or not a sudden extinction of a species is a direct result of human interaction? I can imagine quick extinction of species has happened many times before modern humans appeared on earth.

This also leads to my next thought: I imagine it can be very easy to make conclusions to any type of species extinction event as that of human involvement. How do scientists know when to rule out human involvement, when we seemingly interact with every aspect of the environment and all life on earth one way or another? Every single time I‚Äôve read the result of an extinction or endangerment of a species being from human involvement, I never even have a second thought or skepticism of these claims, which is bad basic science as EVERYTHING should be questioned. 

Overall, how could we know saving an endangered species is actually bad for the balance of its respective ecology?",1593313019

14,ecology,Breaking Into Ecology with a BA in English,"Hey Everyone--been lurking in this community for a few months and finally decided to post. Looking for some advice on my (somewhat) unique situation:

I went to college &amp; got a BA in English. Originally I wanted to be a technical writer, but I struggled to find a job and ended up in marketing. I'm now working in a marketing position that pays well, but crushes my soul every minute. Earlier this year I actually had a breakdown that was partially stress-induced and I realized I needed to make a change. I started to read up on different jobs &amp; found that I really like the idea of being a field researcher or wildlife/conservation biologist. I love being outdoors, I was good at bio in HS/early on in college &amp; I've heard that working as a researcher can provide a good work/life balance.

From my own research I've found that it's pretty difficult to break into Ecology/Environmental Science with an unrelated degree. I already know I need to go back to school &amp; there's even a Master's program I'm interested in. Unfortunately the program is a bit competitive &amp; I'm not sure how to start carving a path toward it. I'm aware I'll probably need to take some post-bac classes, but I have some specific questions:

* What's the best way for me to gain research/field experience with a full-time job? Is this possible?
* Will it be possible for me to get into a Masters program without a science background? How can I compete with students w/ environmental degrees?
* How can I build the skills/background needed to work in ecology prior to a Masters?
* Are there any other avenues for me to break into ecology/environmental work without a Master's?
* Any general tips for someone in my scenario?

My situation is a bit difficult because I live on my own &amp; have no family support. I'm unable to move back home in order to pursue another BS full-time and a 4-year degree just ins't plausible at my age (twenty-six). I'm willing to put in the work to make this change, but I'm not sure I see a concrete path forward right now. 

I appreciate anyone with answers, insights or general ideas.

15,ecology,Ecological scientists: I'm an agroecologist curious about your perspective/approach to statistics and methodological design for your studies in ecology!,"Hello, see the title. As much as I admire your discipline, I come from a more traditional agronomic background, in terms of the lab I worked in in graduate school. I am currently a research scientist at an agricultural experiment station in the Caribbean, but have long nursed an explicit interest in agroecology. I now have the chance to design a complex systems study more or less from scratch. 

I am hitting the wall in terms of first steps to understanding a totally new kind of study and method for me. I am traditionally familiar with controlled field plot experiments, 1 to 3 years in duration, with a single set of response variables to answer a single research question, analyzed with traditional inferential statistics such as ANOVA in an RCBD design. 

All well and good, but I am much more interested in attempting something much more flexibile and holistic to gather a wide variety of data on an entire system (a breadfruit orchard), inspired by the general lack of published information on this kind of system. 

This is where you ecologists come in (I hope). Would any of you be willing to chat with me about your own studies and the methods you use? I am a blank slate, I think anything I hear from you would be of interest. I am OF COURSE willing to consult literature but have found it difficult to find a starting point to begin my reading. As you know, most studies are not explicitly focused on questions of methodology and, as I am not an ecologist in any real sense (yet?), I have found it hard to search with that as my primary interest. 

I have read some about ""quasi-experiments"" and some of the comparative field studies that you can do, but I want to hear about specifics. Spatial statistics, for example, interests me as a general concept but I would like to hear more, much more.

Abstract: Individuals of large or dark‚Äêcolored ectothermic species often have a higher reproduction and activity than small or light‚Äêcolored ones. However, investments into body size or darker colors should negatively affect the fitness of individuals as they increase their growth and maintenance costs. Thus, it is unlikely that morphological traits directly affect species‚Äô distribution and abundance. Yet, this simplification is frequently made in trait‚Äêbased ecological analyses. Here, we integrated the energy allocation strategies of species into an ecophysiological framework to explore the mechanisms that link species‚Äô morphological traits and population dynamics. We hypothesized that the effects of morphological traits on species‚Äô distribution and abundance are not direct but mediated by components of the energy budget and that species can allocate more energy towards dispersal and reproduction if they compensate their energetic costs by reducing mobility costs or increasing energy uptake. To classify species‚Äô energy allocation strategies, we used easily measured proxies for the mobility costs and energy uptake of butterflies that can be also applied to other taxa. We demonstrated that contrasting effects of morphological traits on distribution and abundance of butterfly species offset each other when species‚Äô energy allocation strategies are not taken into account. Larger and darker butterfly species had wider distributions and were more abundant if they compensated the investment into body size and color darkness (i.e. melanin) by reducing their mobility costs or increasing energy uptake. Adults of darker species were more mobile and foraged less compared to lighter colored ones, if an investment into melanin was indirectly compensated via a size‚Äêdependent reduction of mobility costs or increase of energy uptake. Our results indicate that differences in the energy allocations strategies of species account for a considerable part of the variation in species‚Äô distribution and abundance that is left unexplained by morphological traits alone and ignoring these differences can lead to false mechanistic conclusions. Therefore, our findings highlight the potential of integrating proxies for species‚Äô energy allocation strategies into trait‚Äêbased models not only for understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying variation in species‚Äô distribution and abundance, but also for improving predictions of the population dynamics of species.",1592795814

There is also an online research fellowship I'm thinking of taking to get me more exposed to data analysis and interpretation. I've asked around for professors' suggestions on what I could do to boost my application or what kind/how much field experience they look for in master candidates, but I either get no response or just get told to keep doing what I'm doing.

Abstract: Management of semi-natural grasslands is essential to retain the characteristic diversity of flora and fauna found in these habitats. To maintain, restore or recreate favourable conditions for grassland species, knowledge regarding how they occur in relation to grazing intensity and soil nutrient availability is crucial. We focused on grassland plant species, i.e., species selected to indicate high natural values in semi-natural grasslands. Environmental monitoring data collected at 366 grassland sites in southern Sweden between 2006 and 2010 were used to relate the occurrence of indicator species to factors describing geographic location, local site conditions related to nutrients and moisture, and management. Site productivity, soil moisture and cover of trees and shrubs were the main structuring factors, while other factors related to management had a lesser effect (grass sward height, amount of litter, type of grazer). Not surprisingly, these patterns were also reflected in species-wise analyses of the 25 most commonly occurring indicator species, with almost all species negatively related to site productivity and most also to soil moisture. Furthermore, many species were negatively affected by increasing sward height and litter. In contrast, species-wise responses varied among species in relation to increasing cover of trees and shrubs. In comparison to cattle grazing, sheep grazing was detrimental to six species and beneficial to none, while horse grazing was detrimental to no species and beneficial to four species. When evaluating species traits, taller plant species were favoured when site productivity, grass sward height and the amount of grass litter were high. There were no strong patterns related to the flowering time, leaf arrangement, or nutrient and light requirements of species. These results highlight the importance of nutrient-poor and dry sites, e.g., when selecting sites for conservation, and the importance of the type of management executed.",1592195915

I graduated back in 2017 with an Honours BA in psych and a minor in public policy and administration. My original plan was to go for an MSW after that but I realized too late that this career path wasn't for me. I've been working in insurance since then, from customer service to data entry to QA/UAT. I absolutely hate it and need a change to something I'm passionate about, and I've strongly been considering wildlife conservation/environmental science/ecology and going back to school for it.

I've got a few questions.

1) Has anybody pivoted from an unrelated degree into ecology? Any experience or thoughts on it?

2) Most of the schools around where I live offer MES programs (Masters in Environmental Science). What was the program like? Did you enjoy it? How competitive was admission? I'm probably going to need to take some prereqs but I'm hoping the statistics/biology courses from the psych degree come in handy there.

3) How restrictive is an MES? Is the field of ecology more focused on what kind of education you have or the experience you have? I'm just wondering how flexible the MES is in the variety of jobs (wildlife conservation, consulting, policy, etc) it opens up for you. 

4) What do you do for a living, and do you enjoy your work?

I wanted to read more about that idea, so I did a bit of googling and found out about the ""mega-culture"" of apes that exists in the Bili-Eule forest in the Congo; a civilization of apes that has been theorized to be in the thousands, or possibly even tens of thousands. This culture of this civilization includes the incorporation of a militia (groups of males patrol the borders of the area to protect the masses), usage of tools and the passing down of this technology in tradition (females teach their young to use rocks to split open massive snail shells to eat the snails), as well as forest floor-based nests (a sign that they've primarily overcome ground-dwelling threats, such as leopards). How is this possible? Is it possible that the apes are engaging in some sort of simple organized religion? Is there another explanation as to how this huge society was able to form? Or am I misunderstanding ""mega culture"" to mean something that it doesn't, and the vast numbers of apes in this region aren't actually unified into any abnormally sized society?",1591728127

Abstract: Mesotrophic rich fens, that is, groundwater-fed mires, may be long-lasting, as well as transient ecosystems, displaced in time by poor fens, bogs, forests or eutrophic reeds. We hypothesized that fen stability is controlled by plant stress caused by waterlogging with calcium-rich and nutrient-poor groundwater, which limits expansion of hummock mosses, tussock sedges and trees. We analysed 32 European Holocene macrofossil profiles of rich fens using plant functional traits (PFTs) which indicate the level of plant stress in the environment: canopy height, clonal spread, diaspore mass, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, Ellenberg moisture value, hummock-forming ability, mycorrhizal status and plant functional groups. Six PFTs, which formed long-term significant trends during mire development, were compiled as rich fen stress indicator (RFSI). We found that RFSI values at the start of fen development were correlated with the thickness of subsequently accumulated rich fen peat. RFSI declined in fens approaching change into another mire type, regardless whether it was shifting into bog, forest or eutrophic reeds. RFSI remained comparatively high and stable in three rich fens, which have not terminated naturally until present times. By applying PFT analysis to macrofossil data, we demonstrated that fens may undergo a gradual autogenic process, which lowers the ecosystem‚Äôs resistance and enhances shifts to other mire types. Long-lasting rich fens, documented by deep peat deposits, are rare. Because autogenic processes tend to alleviate stress in fens, high levels of stress are needed at initial stages of rich fen development to enable its long persistence and continuous peat accumulation.",1591590583

*Bees are hibernational species, harvesting honey to feed their young during winter. In fact, enslavement into industrial monocultures may be the cause of colony collapse, and that being said, I don't find issue with farming honey from them, at reasonable levels of course. Bees should be trained, and you should friend your bees, without domestication. Keep in mind your local pollination factors. Bees are the opposite of climate crises.* 

from ""The Ecologist Organization"" (2015CE):

[submitted hyperlink to supporting scientific article.](http://theecologist.org/2015/may/02/bee-collapse-result-their-enslavement-industrial-monocultures)

**opinion summary abstract**:

monoculture is the polar opposite of biodiversity.

**a brief explanation**:

1. biodiversity sustains life for climate spheres (biomes).
2. a climate is a 30-year pattern over time.
3. monocultures have no virtual potential to adapt; and,
4. more specifically: a diverse beefarm culture causes sustainable harvest.

**prerequisites**:

a) *natural selection*

understanding that evolution is composed of random adaptations to conditions.

b) *genetic drift*

the surviving adaptations cause genetic trends; sustainable mutations survive.

c) *hence*

biodiverse bee cultures result in greater potential to survive climate losses.",1591316982

Abstract: Adult flower‚Äêvisiting insects feed on nectar and pollen and partly collect floral resources to feed their larvae. The reduction in food availability has therefore been proposed as one of the main causes for the drastic decline in flower‚Äêvisiting insects in Central Europe. We compared the current (2012‚Äì2017) abundances of food plants of different groups of flower‚Äêvisiting insects to that of 1900‚Äì1930 in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Comparisons were done separately for different vegetation types, flowering months, and groups of diurnal flower‚Äêvisiting insects, such as bees, bumble bees, wasps, butterflies, hoverflies, flies, and beetles. We found a general decrease in food plant abundance for all groups of flower‚Äêvisiting insects and in all vegetation types except ruderal areas. Reductions of food plant abundance were most pronounced for wetlands and agricultural fields, reflecting the massive transformation of wetlands into other habitat types and the intensified management of agricultural fields. Food plant abundance for specialized flower visitors (bees, bumble bees, butterflies) of wetlands decreased most strongly in May and for generalized flower visitors (wasps, hoverflies, flies, beetles) in July. Specialized plant species, i.e., species with few groups of flower visitors, decreased more strongly in abundance than species with many groups of flower visitors. Finally, we found a homogenization of food plant assemblages in all vegetation types except ruderal areas, where the opposite pattern emerged. Our results suggest a significant reduction in the diversity and abundance of food plants for flower‚Äêvisiting insects over the past century, which has been most severe for the more specialized insect groups. The trend of insect decline, in particular those specialized on few plant species, can only be stopped by extending suitable habitats, i.e., by increasing food availability and reestablish selected plant populations.",1590992149

For context, I am looking at Willow aphids and willow plants, so it is a species we know interact elsewhere in the world, however they are a very new pest to my country therefore our willow species have not previously been exposed. 

I was thinking of going along the lines of exposing a certain number of pests to said plant, and seeing if the population changes in response (e.g. if the pest chooses to stay or if it leaves). However I am not sure what statistical analysis I could potentially do for this.

Abstract: Worldwide, stream water is increasingly loaded with sediments and nutrients, due to processes such as accelerated soil erosion and overfertilization caused by agricultural intensification. This leads to increases in eutrophication and silting up of bottom sediments. Floodplains can play an important role in mitigating these problems, by removing sediment from rivers via water filtration and retention. Fine sediment is accumulated on the soil in between plants as well as on plant surfaces. However, it is still poorly understood how plant species facilitate leaf surface sedimentation via their leaf traits. In a flume experiment, we investigated to what extent the leaf traits (area, length, perimeter, pinnation, pubescence, surface roughness, flexibility and wettability) influence leaf surface sedimentation. We exposed leaves of 30 plant species to an artificial flood, and measured the fine sediment load the leaves captured after 24 h. Our results show that leaf traits overall explain 65% of the variation of fine sedimentation on leaves. Especially adaxial pubescence and leaf area strongly drove sedimentation. Hairy leaves accumulate more sediment per leaf area, presumably, because hairs create a buffer zone of reduced flow velocity which enhances sedimentation between the hairs. Additionally, for leaves with no or few hairs, sedimentation decreased with increasing leaf area, because most likely the more turbulent boundary layer of larger leaves allows less sediment to settle. Our results provide a first understanding of how plants can be selected based on their leaf traits for maximizing the sediment retention on floodplains, thereby providing a key ecosystem service.",1590376063

Abstract: We compared a rapid bioassessment protocol (Traveling Sweep Approach [TSA]) with a more conventional time intensive protocol (Composite Transect Approach [CTA]) to describe macroinvertebrates in wetlands in Alberta, Canada. We collected one macroinvertebrate sample using each protocol from 16 wetlands and compared abundance, catch per unit effort, and relative abundance between sample protocols. We also quantified and compared the logistics required to implement each protocol. The macroinvertebrate communities differed statistically between protocols for all three response variables; however, the differences were generally small and communities similar. The CTA protocol tended to yield higher variability in the samples, likely driven by the way these samples are collected and composited, which may introduce an unwanted source of variation when the primary monitoring objective is to assess effects of human activities over time and between sites. The CTA protocol also required significantly greater investment of time (ca. 50% greater processing time), money (ca. 1.9 times sample processing cost), and resources to execute (e.g., requirement for watercraft). Both protocols provided adequate characterization of macroinvertebrate communities in wetlands, but differences in variability and resources for deployment and processing are important considerations when choosing a sampling protocol. The rapid time-limited sweep protocol (TSA) appears to be a viable monitoring approach given that macroinvertebrate communities identified by each protocol were relatively similar but were collected using the TSA protocol at a lower cost.",1589771100

2. The graph I linked means that the species number 14 for example is not on the orange community?

3. If the species for example number 8 wasn't on the brown community, there shouldn't be a dot on the 8 rank right?

4. Every graph I found on google has a good curve, but couldn't be the case that maybe species number 10 has a higher relative abundance than number 9 in the orange community, so the line goes up?

 Hello,

 I am a member of an organization called the Cheeky Scientist Association (CSA). I want to report out my story of feeling disrespected and outright lied to by this group's job hunt assistance program. I feel they¬†prey on scared PhD holders who are worried about their job outlook, then do not deliver on services promised.¬†  
I would highly encourage Master's or PhD level job seekers to stay away from this organization. Here is my story...  
The CSA program advertises that they offer career advice for PhD holders interested in transitioning into industry careers. They claim that all PhD holders are ""highly in demand"".¬†I have been with the group for several months and paid over $400 for an initial membership.

The following is a list of inappropriate and borderline fraudulent behavior I experienced during my time with this organization.

1) CSA offered me a ""pay only once"" lifetime membership. Once enrolled in the main program, I was told that numerous specialized modules on offer are ""pay to access"", at a price tag of several hundred¬†dollars per module.  


2) CSA repeatedly and consistently claims that all PhD skills are ""highly in demand"". They claim¬†that companies are eagerly looking to hire candidates such as yourself. I believe this claim to be objectively false. I do believe there is a small, select subset of in-demand skills that are desired in industry. This is a vastly different reality than CSA's claim that employers are rushing to hire any and all PhD holders.

3) CSA consistently promotes a narrative that if you're not getting hired, it's your own fault for not trying hard enough. That message is emotionally abusive. It pushes all accountability¬†away from CSA and onto¬†the paying¬†client. They consistently blame you, the client, for any job hunt failures you are experiencing.

4) When I began raising questions about the program's methodology, I was passive aggressively threatened. My most recent post to the group's private Facebook page was a note expressing that a ""think positive"" mentality didn't work for me personally. That post was deleted in less than three hours and my account was immediately suspended. I was told the reason for the suspension was unrelated to the post I've referenced here.

I feel motivated to report my story to a larger audience because I am not alone in my criticism.

Dozens of clients have reported they feel uncomfortable with how the Cheeky Scientist program is managed. My fellow clients have questioned why the claims of the program don't match the lived experience of their job hunts. These clients payed $400 or more, often while working low-wage jobs and paying off student debt, for this fraudulent¬†service.¬†

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this message. If you find yourself concerned by this report, please forward this note to any PhD email lists you have access to.

Abstract: Documenting which species interact within ecological communities is challenging and labor intensive. As a result, many interactions remain unrecorded, potentially distorting our understanding of network structure and dynamics. We test the utility of four structural models and a new coverage‚Äêdeficit model for predicting missing links in both simulated and empirical bipartite networks. We find they can perform well, although the predictive power of structural models varies with the underlying network structure. The accuracy of predictions can be improved by ensembling multiple models. Augmenting observed networks with most‚Äêlikely missing links improves estimates of qualitative network metrics. Tools to identify likely missing links can be simple to implement, allowing the prioritization of research effort and more robust assessment of network properties.",1589177717

It is only the beginning, not the end. Tipping points happen long before the end. Nobody knows exactly when except in hindsight, after it's already too late. This is very very important.

Note: The renewable charts are by the Wall Street Journal, and British Petroleum Statistical Review in 2019, for the Saudi initial public offering of their state oil company. This is one of the 21st century's biggest deals worth hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and where accurate information is essential for investors. You can always find pro green energy numbers that tell a very different story, depending on what they loosely define as green energy. I.E. - burning trees and palm oil and calling it green energy doesn't make it so. Dams cause methane emissions and kill river life, but they are called green. To get enough algae ponds for one third of electricity demand would require enough land about the size of Argentina. The only thing people lie about more than climate is energy.

I have been working in humanitarian aid and development for the past 10+ years, but I‚Äôve got a family now and it‚Äôs getting increasingly difficult to find positions that are safe and keep my family together. I‚Äôm hoping that a shift within the same types of organizations (UN and NGOs) with a different focus might be a smoother transition, and one that‚Äôs less likely to send me back to war zones.

Everywhere I‚Äôve worked I‚Äôve noticed extensive environmental degradation, and its direct and indirect contribution to major developmental challenges that we‚Äôre spending billions trying to address, but with comparatively little being done to address the root problems in many cases. This interest led to me enrolling in an online natural resource management master‚Äôs program at a US university. Unfortunately, one semester in it appears that the focus of the program seems to be almost entirely on applications related to US national parks. I can see how some aspects may apply in development contexts, but they‚Äôre not really closely aligned.

Does anyone have any experience working in the nexus of natural resource management and development? Is this even a realistic expectation? Does anyone know of any programs that might more closely fit my experience and goals? Any other advice for making this pivot?

While I understand (begrudgingly) that wildfire mitigation is necessary in densely populated areas (guilty of adding to that need, I know), it seems as if the canyon's vegetation takes a major hit. Those areas that are not cleared seem to be thriving at the moment. I'm wondering how this affects root growth and thus subsidence reduction. Biodiversity (won't the weeds come back stronger?).

Abstract: Feeding interactions between fish species and crustaceans are not rare, such as the relations between cleaner shrimps and reef fishes (Hork√° et al. 2018) and between parasitic isopods and their fish hosts (Baeza 2015). In most of these cases the fish plays the main role as host and the crustacean a secondary role as associated species (Karplus 2014). This report presents an example of the opposite.",1588569685

In narrowing it down, I think that what I have continually come back to is helping with the mitigation of the ongoing and impending ecological collapse the planet is collectively experiencing. What I feel this area of work would entail is protecting species and their habitats. That means working to stop the destruction of habitat, restoring habitats, taking measures to protect habitats and species, conducting studies to find out the effects our actions may be having on the things around us, removing invasive species, educating the public, managing natural resources (I would certainly welcome more info on this aspect!), etc. With that being said...where do I go from here?

Question 1. What promising ecological industries could replace the profits made from biomass and forestry?

Because Oxygen dammit) To make this question difficult, let's rule out solar and wind as an option. I do this because I often like to use the great example of a place like British Columbia, where solar has high potential, but trees often need to be cleared for solar/wind farms to be built.

Question 2. If citizens cannot tell their governments to halt biomass and forestry production, because governments often yield to investor giants and stock giants, how could citizens convince big investors to pull their shares out of forestry and biomass and into the often less predictable, ecologically sustainable resources that could become green stock giants (if not already existing)

Abstract: The US Endangered Species Act (ESA) is an important safety net for the protection and recovery of critically imperiled species. One mechanism of the ESA is prohibitions on harming listed species and their habitat, yet the ESA does not require proactive conservation by the private sector, which is necessary for the recovery of many species. A range of ESA programs have been developed ‚Äì including Candidate Conservation Agreements, Safe Harbor Agreements, and a Voluntary Prelisting Conservation Actions policy ‚Äì to enhance flexibility and encourage voluntary conservation activities. But why would businesses and other private landowners voluntarily engage in proactive conservation efforts above and beyond what is required for ESA compliance? We applied a return‚Äêon‚Äêinvestment (ROI) perspective to outline sources of costs and benefits and to explore program participation incentives. This ROI perspective sheds light on the types of financial factors likely to affect private‚Äêsector participation and program effectiveness, and points to better ways to target private‚Äêsector engagement and design more effective programs.",1587956689

For these reasons, and to help spread awareness of the impact of light pollution, I wanted to share this sub with you. 

I think that the ecological side is very important, and so I hope there will be more content in that vein on the sub in the future. Hope to see you there!",1587678484

Abstract: It has been suggested that biogeographic historical legacies in plant diversity may influence ecosystem functioning. This is expected because of known diversity effects on ecosystem functions, and impacts of historical events such as past climatic changes on plant diversity. However, empirical evidence for a link between biogeographic history and present‚Äêday ecosystem functioning is still limited. Here, we explored the relationships between Late‚ÄêQuaternary climate instability, species‚Äêpool size, local species and functional diversity, and the net primary productivity (NPP) of Northern Hemisphere forests using structural equation modelling. Our study confirms that past climate instability has negative effects on plant functional diversity and through that on NPP, after controlling for present‚Äêday climate, soil conditions, stand biomass and age. We conclude that global models of terrestrial plant productivity need to consider the biogeographical context to improve predictions of plant productivity and feedbacks with the climate system.",1587352558

57,ecology,What's your resume look like?,"I'm located in the PNW. I'm applying for entry level jobs and getting no nibbles. I have one three month internship with a state agency under my belt, but other than that no real experience other than my degree in ecology (this quarter I was set up for another internship but it was cancelled due to the COVID social distancing orders). Most of the jobs I am applying for are seasonal and only require a GED or Associates (I'll be graduating with dual 4 year degrees in ecology and public policy soon). I would love to apply for full time positions but I am pessimistic I'll land anything with the way this is going. 

I am starting to wonder if maybe my resume is the issue. Regardless, I plan to volunteer doing relevant duties to gain more experience because I'm sure I'll be in customer service for awhile after I graduate after this quarter. I took the advice this agency I worked for to heart:

* Include salary from previous jobs
* Include schedule from previous jobs
* Include dates worked in work experience (duh).
* List education before work experience (since that's what I have that's most relevant currently).
* Resume can be up to 4-5 pages, mine's at about 3.
* Resume follows this format: Objective, education (includes brief list of relevant courses), work experience (internship most recently listed), skills, references.

(I would love critique of my resume but am paranoid of linking it on the internet, though I am more than happy to send a link via a PM with my information edited out!). 

In applying for jobs I will frequently edit my resume to include terminology listed in the job advertisements (so if a posting says ""plant monitoring"" rather than ""plant surveying"" I'll change my wording to say ""monitoring"". 

I am wondering how your resumes are structured and what formula you all follow for resumes and cover letters.

The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization‚Äôs executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.

 You are welcome to initiate a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.


If not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-

1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. 

2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. 

3. Artists, musicians, singers, poets, dancers, anyone with a creative streak who would like to express and promote the cause of environmental sustainability through art forms!

Abstract: Habitat loss can trigger migration network collapse by isolating migratory bird breeding grounds from nonbreeding grounds. Theoretically, habitat loss can have vastly different impacts depending on the site's importance within the migratory corridor. However, migration‚Äênetwork connectivity and the impacts of site loss are not completely understood. We used GPS tracking data on 4 bird species in the Asian flyways to construct migration networks and proposed a framework for assessing network connectivity for migratory species. We used a node‚Äêremoval process to identify stopover sites with the highest impact on connectivity. In general, migration networks with fewer stopover sites were more vulnerable to habitat loss. Node removal in order from the highest to lowest degree of habitat loss yielded an increase of network resistance similar to random removal. In contrast, resistance increased more rapidly when removing nodes in order from the highest to lowest betweenness value (quantified by the number of shortest paths passing through the specific node). We quantified the risk of migration network collapse and identified crucial sites by first selecting sites with large contributions to network connectivity and then identifying which of those sites were likely to be removed from the network (i.e., sites with habitat loss). Among these crucial sites, 42% were not designated as protected areas. Setting priorities for site protection should account for a site's position in the migration network, rather than only site‚Äêspecific characteristics. Our framework for assessing migration‚Äênetwork connectivity enables site prioritization for conservation of migratory species.",1586747645

15,ecology,Self-teaching data analysis/coding and ecology cover letter advice?,"So I found my pre-masters dream job for a ecology data analyst position through an institute that is a part of my dream masters program. I want to go into ecological modeling, problem is that I don't have lots of coding skills. I did an independent study in undergrad to try and learn R (learned very basic stuff), did my undergrad thesis statistics using JMP, and have a basic idea of how to use linux. So my best bet is to teach myself as much as I can independently using the internet. I know there are programs like codeacademy or coursera for learning R and python, but are there any programs or books that teach R or python programming by using ecological datasets as practice?

I know that I can teach myself how to program in these languages and through linux, 1) because this is a job in a field that I'm passionate about and is directly related to what I want to do for grad school and 2) because I have lots of time on my hands (was recently evacuated from Peace Corps so quarantine is giving me lots of time). I know that I will take whatever time it takes and perverse through the challenges to learn how to program and analyze data, even after getting the job since programming frustrations are a given. So my question for experienced ecology folks is how do I best get that across in my cover letter/resume? Is there a way to convincingly show that even though I don't formally have all those skills through an academic setting I have the drive and work ethic to acquire those skills (and am currently trying to acquire them?)

Most human food production is done at the expense of the wild world. We either just take stuff from the wild (eg taking wild fish) or we steal a chunk of land from the wild world and use it exclusively to produce food for humans.

I live in the UK, and write now there are serious concerns in some quarters about food security. We cannot feed ourselves without a lot of imports, we don't have any spare land, and we desperately need to hold on to the few wild areas that remain.

But seaweed farming seems to be the exception. It is almost a non-existent industry in Europe, but in important part of the national diets in south-east Asia. Not much use a source of calories, but an extremely useful food source in all other respects.

My question is whether there's an ecological downside I haven't noticed. Seaweed needs no fertiliser, makes no pollution, takes only water, sunlight, CO2 and elements dissolved in seawater. It also must provide a useful habitat for juvenile fish and other small marine creatures.

Looks like a win/win - helps human civilisation and the wild world at the same time. Yes?",1585857322
41,ecology,Could the introduction of beavers to the russian far east increase the density of megafauna there?,"Specifically in Khabarovsk krai, which doesn‚Äôt have the unique flora of primorsky krai.

The entire far east has far fewer siberian tigers and other megafauna than one would expect in a similarly sized location in the tropics. Siberian tigers require a much larger range than bengal tigers.

But the mammoth steppe in the ice age had megafauna levels similar to the african savannah because the wildlife can consume grass more easily than wood.

Basically, beavers cut down trees, even eat them and release the stored nutrients, and transform areas around rivers to meadows and grasslands. Grass and shrub supports far more large wildlife than trees do. The region has plenty of rivers. I believe that this transformation could increase the number and density of megafauna in the region, providing more prey for the siberian tigers, reducing the calories they need to spend to find food in the first place, and increase their population.

Bears over there will be fine because there are plenty of bears and there will still be plenty of forest. And they could hunt too.",1585840946

51,ecology,New England White Pine Monoforest,"     I've got nothing against pines, and nothing against ecosystems dominated by one species, but in the case of Pinus strobus it seems fragile, as it may not be a 'natural' forest type.  If anyone can elaborate or correct any of the thoughts below, I'd much appreciate it!
     In New England (North Eastern United States), most of our land was cleared for agriculture. Up to 90% in Massachusetts. I understand that the white pine formed occasional mature stands in the diverse precolonial mosaic forest, but that it wasn't nearly as widespread as a dominant tree. 
    White pines seed aggressively into abandoned fields, and so were perfectly poised to cover New England. I believe they would normally be controlled by fire (wild and anthropogenic), particularly as saplings. They also retain their dead lower limbs, which increases the fire-load.  By allowing dense white pines, are we building a tinder-box?
    I understand that we need tree-cover, but is it all created equal? I recently had an ecologist tell me not to thin pines, because 'carbon is carbon'. But I wonder if that's not seeing the forest for the trees. Larger trees absorb more carbon than young ones, and most of the white pine saplings will die anyways, releasing their carbon. May it be better to thin them to allow bigger trees to form faster and do their thing?
     As white pines restrict the growth of other trees, are we at risk of losing tree diversity?  Monocultures are famously fragile, and we already see the spread of some white pine pathogens.  
     A mature white pine surely creates a lot of food in the form of pine kernals, but what of their younger years? It seems the may form a nutrition desert, inhibiting other food producing species.

Like I said, I've got great appreciation for the white pine, as huge solitary wolf-trees and as  cathedral stands. I just wonder if we are having too much of a good thing.",1585675348

Abstract: The eelgrass Zostera marina is an important foundation species of coastal areas in the Northern Hemisphere, but is continuing to decline, despite management actions. The development of new management tools is therefore urgent in order to prioritize limited resources for protecting meadows most vulnerable to local extinctions and identifying most valuable present and historic meadows to protect and restore, respectively. We assessed 377 eelgrass meadows along the complex coastlines of two fjord regions on the Swedish west coast ‚Äîone is currently healthy and the other is substantially degraded. Shoot dispersal for all meadows was assessed with Lagrangian biophysical modelling (scale: 100‚Äê1000 m) and used for barrier analysis and clustering; a subset (n=22) was also assessed with population genetic methods (20 microsatellites) including diversity, structure and network connectivity. Both approaches were in very good agreement, resulting in seven subpopulation groupings or management units (MUs). The MUs correspond to a spatial scale appropriate for coastal management of ‚Äúwaterbodies‚Äù used in the European Water Framework Directive. Adding demographic modelling based on the genetic and biophysical data as a third approach, we are able to assess past, present and future metapopulation dynamics to identify especially vulnerable and valuable meadows. In a further application, we show how the biophysical approach, using eigenvalue perturbation theory (EPT) and distribution records from the 1980s, can be used to identify lost meadows where restoration would best benefit the present metapopulation. The combination of methods, presented here as a toolbox, allows the assessment of different temporal and spatial scales at the same time, as well as ranking of specific meadows according to key genetic, demographic and ecological metrics. It could be applied to any species or region, and we exemplify its versatility as a management guide for eelgrass along the Swedish west coast.",1585537588

We assessed 377 eelgrass meadows along the complex coastlines of two fjord regions on the Swedish west coast ‚Äîone is currently healthy and the other is substantially degraded. Shoot dispersal for all meadows was assessed with Lagrangian biophysical modelling (scale: 100‚Äê1000 m) and used for barrier analysis and clustering; a subset (n=22) was also assessed with population genetic methods (20 microsatellites) including diversity, structure and network connectivity. Both approaches were in very good agreement, resulting in seven subpopulation groupings or management units (MUs). The MUs correspond to a spatial scale appropriate for coastal management of ‚Äúwaterbodies‚Äù used in the European Water Framework Directive. Adding demographic modelling based on the genetic and biophysical data as a third approach, we are able to assess past, present and future metapopulation dynamics to identify especially vulnerable and valuable meadows. In a further application, we show how the biophysical approach, using eigenvalue perturbation theory (EPT) and distribution records from the 1980s, can be used to identify lost meadows where restoration would best benefit the present metapopulation. The combination of methods, presented here as a toolbox, allows the assessment of different temporal and spatial scales at the same time, as well as ranking of specific meadows according to key genetic, demographic and ecological metrics. It could be applied to any species or region, and we exemplify its versatility as a management guide for eelgrass along the Swedish west coast.",1584930930

Abstract: Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding has revolutionized biomonitoring in both marine and freshwater ecosystems. However, for semi‚Äêaquatic and terrestrial animals, the application of this technique remains relatively untested. We first assess the efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding in detecting semi‚Äêaquatic and terrestrial mammals in natural lotic ecosystems in the UK by comparing sequence data recovered from water and sediment samples to the mammalian communities expected from historical data. Secondly, using occupancy modelling we compared the detection efficiency of eDNA metabarcoding to multiple conventional non‚Äêinvasive survey methods (latrine surveys and camera trapping). eDNA metabarcoding detected a large proportion of the expected mammalian community within each area. Common species in the areas were detected at the majority of sites. Several key species of conservation concern in the UK were detected by eDNA sampling in areas where authenticated records do not currently exist, but potential false positives were also identified. Water‚Äêbased eDNA metabarcoding provided comparable results to conventional survey methods in per unit of survey effort for three species (water vole, field vole and red deer) using occupancy models. The comparison between survey ‚Äòeffort‚Äô to reach a detection probability of ‚â•.95 revealed that 3‚Äì6 water replicates would be equivalent to 3‚Äì5 latrine surveys and 5‚Äì30 weeks of single camera deployment, depending on the species. Synthesis and applications. eDNA metabarcoding can be used to generate an initial ‚Äòdistribution map‚Äô of mammalian diversity at the landscape level. If conducted during times of peak abundance, carefully chosen sampling points along multiple river courses provide a reliable snapshot of the species that are present in a catchment area. In order to fully capture solitary, rare and invasive species, we would currently recommend the use of eDNA metabarcoding alongside other non‚Äêinvasive surveying methods (i.e. camera traps) to maximize monitoring efforts.",1584327895

24,ecology,Greeting from Russia! A question about the deforestation problem in Australia,"Hey everyone! Hope you're doing great :)

I am a 2nd year Graduate School of Management student, the best business school in Russia, ranked #23 in Financial Times ranking.

And I really need your help! Currently my team is working on the project trying to tackle the problem of deforestation in Australia. We have one really neat solution we would like to introduce in our project: seedballs. These are seeds of different plant species covered in coal dust. In Kenya, they are spread all around by planes, thus providing the lands with an effective solution for deforestation. You can find more on this by following the link: http://www.seedballskenya.com/

We would LOVE to use the experience of this company in Australia, but we lack information on whether it is worth it. We tried to search the Internet looking for answers to our questions, but it was no use. That is why we decided to ask Australians, because obviously there cannot be any better source of information about Australia :)

We are interested in the following questions:

1) Is this seedballs thing being used to fight deforestation in Australia right now? If yes, could you please share any link(s) to companies doing that?

2) There is a list of plant species Seedballs Kenya is using as their source of seeds. You can find the list here: http://www.seedballskenya.com/species-info/4594445434. The question is: do you know of a way to check whether these plants are subject to any biodiversity restrictions in Austalia? We would like to know if it is possible to export these plants/seeds from Kenya and import them to Australia.

3) Do you know of any plants in Australia that CAN be used as a source for seedballs in Australia? It should not necessarily be included into the list of species used by Kenya Seedballs. But if such a species grows in Australia, then it is just another way around the biodiversity restrictions.

We would be really happy if someone happens to know ANY info on the topic and especially any information related to the questions above.

Abstract: Policies designed to address current challenges to the sustainability of fisheries generally use an ecosystem‚Äêbased approach ‚Äì one that incorporates interactions between fishes, fishers, and the environment. Fishing alters the trophic structure among coral reef fish but properly assessing those impacts requires an understanding of how and why that structure varies naturally across scales. Using a combination of small‚Äê and large‚Äêscale surveys, we generated biomass pyramids for 20 uninhabited Pacific islands, and found that (1) the distribution of reef fish biomass across trophic levels is highly scale dependent: trophic structures that appear top‚Äêheavy at small scales can take a variety of different states when data are integrated across the broader seascape; (2) reefs can have the greatest biomass at intermediate consumer levels, which we describe as ‚Äúmiddle‚Äêdriven‚Äù systems; and (3) in unfished coral reef systems, trophic structure is strongly predicted by energy into the base and middle of the food web, as well as by the interacting effect of water temperature.",1583723309

I'm having a little anxiety about staying in the field of ecology, in terms of career options and stuff.

If anyone has any insight into any of the following questions, I would really appreciate any advice. I've included a bunch of background stuff below if you find any of it relevant. Thanks!

1) What are career options for a non-US citizen with a PhD in Ecology outside of academia?

2) What are the career options for a non-US citizen with a BS in Ecology outside of consulting? (I don't have much knowledge of local biodiversity or field survey experience). 

3) How competitive are these positions? Is it worth pursuing a 6-year PhD commitment if I'm not sure I want to stay in academia? 

4) Are the answers to these questions different outside the US, in Australia and Europe for example. If anyone has any insight into what the market is like in Australia in particular, it would be super helpful as it is much closer to my family and was a cool place to do research when I visited briefly.

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

Where I am now: Graduated with a BS in Ecology last year from a school in the US. Good GPA, lots of lab experience, a little field experience, etc etc

I applied to grad schools in the Fall because I was pushed to do it by an advisor, and have been admitted to a good PhD program (where the grad stipend surprisingly isn't complete horseshit)

I currently work full-time in a herpetology lab as a lab assistant in a landscape genomics project.

I'm an international student, so I didn't qualify for any of the federal fellowships, and it looks like I'm not eligible for 90% of entry level ecology jobs because they're all federal and I don't think I'm mentally cut out for private consulting.

What I'm concerned about: I'm not sure I am very excited about staying in academia. I keep asking myself what I'm going to do after I get the PhD in Ecology, and I can't seem to come up with an answer I'm super excited about. Outside of academia, a lot of the jobs seem to be for federal agencies and it looks like I don't qualify for those. Another concern I have is that a lot of those jobs seem to require in depth knowledge of local flora and fauna, which I do not have - I'm more of a question-oriented guy.

Abstract: There is substantial, growing literature that details positive human health effects, psychological and physiological, of exposure to ‚Äúnature,‚Äù including ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and ‚Äúblue space,‚Äù with evidence suggesting that diversity of species or environments may have specific positive human health benefits. These health benefits are important ecosystem services provided by healthy ecosystems. In this paper, we discuss several critical ecosystem services provided by wetlands including disaster risk reduction, with an emphasis on benefits to human health and well-being. Impacts to human health via damage to ecosystem services from disasters have rarely been considered in disaster planning or mitigation, nor have the health benefits been part of the framework for planning urban greenspaces and land-use. Coastal wetlands can be part of ‚Äúnatural and nature-based‚Äù solutions, minimizing the impacts of disasters by buffering coastal communities from storms and erosion and absorbing flood waters. In addition, mental and physical health benefits of experiencing healthy wetlands could offset some stress and disease encounters related to disasters. Thus, coastal wetlands should be part of a strategy for reducing the risk posed by disasters and facilitating recovery. We conclude with recommendations for research priorities and specific inclusion of wetlands in coastal community planning for disaster response and recovery.",1583122236

Abstract: Satellite data indicate significant advancement in alpine spring phenology over decades of climate warming, but corresponding field evidence is scarce. It is also unknown whether this advancement results from an earlier shift of phenological events, or enhancement of plant growth under unchanged phenological pattern. By analyzing a 35‚Äêyear dataset of seasonal biomass dynamics of a Tibetan alpine grassland, we show that climate change promoted both earlier phenology and faster growth, without changing annual biomass production. Biomass production increased in spring due to a warming‚Äêinduced earlier onset of plant growth, but decreased in autumn due mainly to increased water stress. Plants grew faster but the fast‚Äêgrowing period shortened during the mid‚Äêgrowing season. These findings provide the first in situ evidence of long‚Äêterm changes in growth patterns in alpine grassland plant communities, and suggest that earlier phenology and faster growth will jointly contribute to plant growth in a warming climate.",1582501289

The reflective panels can probably even be made right from the sand, by melting it down using sun energy. I saw a video where a guy was making a house by using a lens on wheels.

The question is:  In historical photos of the lake it is clear that the lake was in a native pine forest loblolly, longleaf, pond pine, sand pine, and slash pine all native to the region.  In the historical pictures the pines are all along the shoreline and densely shown way up beyond the shore with some live oaks.  Would a pine forest been one type of pine or a mixture?

Abstract: Although it is well known that insects are sensitive to temperature, how they will be affected by ongoing global warming remains uncertain because these responses are multifaceted and ecologically complex. We reviewed the effects of climate warming on 31 globally important phytophagous (plant‚Äêeating) insect pests to determine whether general trends in their responses to warming were detectable. We included four response categories (range expansion, life history, population dynamics, and trophic interactions) in this assessment. For the majority of these species, we identified at least one response to warming that affects the severity of the threat they pose as pests. Among these insect species, 41% showed responses expected to lead to increased pest damage, whereas only 4% exhibited responses consistent with reduced effects; notably, most of these species (55%) demonstrated mixed responses. This means that the severity of a given insect pest may both increase and decrease with ongoing climate warming. Overall, our analysis indicated that anticipating the effects of climate warming on phytophagous insect pests is far from straightforward. Rather, efforts to mitigate the undesirable effects of warming on insect pests must include a better understanding of how individual species will respond, and the complex ecological mechanisms underlying their responses.",1581880868

It's come to my attention that I should learn coding for biology, and instead of making Data Science my minor, I was thinking I could instead get certified in Python/R/etc. online through my college. (I want to avoid making this my minor because of the numerous math requirements). 

What would be the most useful coding language to learn for ecology? It seems like its either R or Python.

Would getting my undergrad in general bio. be better than ecology if my ultimate goal is a career in ecology? (I will be getting a masters degree in biology regardless)

Abstract: Spatial subsidies are associated with pronounced ecosystem responses, as nutrients cross ecological boundaries and cascade through food webs. While the importance of subsidies is known, the role of shellfish, specifically molluscs, as a marine subsidy has not been formally described. Focusing primarily on the Pacific coast of North America, we identify vectors that transport shellfish‚Äêderived nutrients into coastal terrestrial environments, including birds, mammals, and over 13 000 yr of marine resource use by people. Evidence from recipient ecosystems suggests shellfish drastically influence soil chemistry, forest productivity and the diversity of primary producers at the regional and landscape level. Responses in higher trophic levels have not yet been investigated, but given documented responses in lower trophic levels, this may be due to a lack of examination. To determine if the processes we describe within the northeast Pacific are pertinent to coastal environments worldwide, we also explore shellfish subsidies globally, with a specific focus on temperate and tropical islands. As shellfish are not as spatially or temporally constrained as other subsidies, our examination suggests our findings are applicable to many other geographical regions along the marine‚Äìterrestrial interface.",1581309001

Abstract: The ability to quantify spatial patterns and detect change in terrestrial vegetation across large landscapes depends on linking ground‚Äêbased measurements of vegetation to remotely sensed data. Unlike non‚Äêoverlapping categorical vegetation types (i.e., typical vegetation and land cover maps), species‚Äêlevel gradients of foliar cover are consistent with the ecological theories of individualistic response of species and niche space. We collected foliar cover data for vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen species and 17 environmental variables in the Arctic Coastal Plain and Brooks Foothills of Alaska from 2012 to 2017. We integrated these data into a standardized database with 13 additional vegetation survey and monitoring datasets in northern Alaska collected from 1998 to 2017. To map the patterns of foliar cover for six dominant and widespread vascular plant species in arctic Alaska, we statistically associated ground‚Äêbased measurements of species distribution and abundance to environmental and multi‚Äêseason spectral covariates using a Bayesian statistical learning approach. For five of the six modeled species, our models predicted 36% to 65% of the observed species‚Äêlevel variation in foliar cover. Overall, our continuous foliar cover maps predicted more of the observed spatial heterogeneity in species distribution and abundance than an existing categorical vegetation map. Mapping continuous foliar cover at the species level also revealed ecological patterns obscured by aggregation in existing plant functional type approaches. Species‚Äêlevel analysis of vegetation patterns enables quantifying and monitoring landscape‚Äêlevel changes in species, vegetation communities, and wildlife habitat independently of subjective categorical vegetation types and facilitates integrating spatial patterns across multiple ecological scales. The novel species‚Äêlevel foliar cover mapping approach described here provides spatial information about the functional role of plant species in vegetation communities and wildlife habitat that are not available in categorical vegetation maps or quantitative maps of broadly defined vegetation aggregates.",1580702654

Abstract: Arthropod predators and parasitoids attack crop pests, providing a valuable ecosystem service. The amount of noncrop habitat surrounding crop fields influences pest suppression, but synthesis of new studies suggests that the spatial configuration of crops and other habitats is similarly important. Natural enemies are often more abundant in fine-grained agricultural landscapes comprising smaller patches and can increase or decrease with the connectivity of crop fields to other habitats. Partitioning organisms by traits has emerged as a promising way to predict the strength and direction of these effects. Furthermore, our ability to predict configurational effects will depend on understanding the potential for indirect effects among trophic levels and the relationship between arthropod dispersal capability and the spatial scale of underlying landscape structure.",1580089472

35,ecology,The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture.,"Hi Ecologist, environmental Scientists &amp; anyone whom is interested in ecology &amp; science in general. 

I‚Äôm writing this has to promote a research based strategy, a framework that has the potential to mitigate the sociopolitical domains within cultures that push back (some more than others) against implementing science based policies.     

The problems:

Any particular person whom doesn't have sufficient knowledge to understand what is meant by the word environment ( e.g., A non Ecologist), may not* be aware that they have a cost/benefit driven ideology (e.g.,A lack of knowledge/misinformation, causing comparably high levels of confirmation bias etc). Status can also add further bias (conformity bias, etc.) within any human social environment/culture.

*(deceit being intentional isn't specifically an, unaware of, psychological bias. Though the deceit maybe motivated by prior unconscious  bias).

The evolutionary strategy:
Therefore, it maybe of critical importance that scientists etc., (whose job description includes aspects of political lobbying, including on social media platforms) also have a level of understanding of human psychology.
The book, The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture, ""is widely considered the foundational text of evolutionary psychology (EP)"".
Anyone whom has studied ecology will find the Adapted Mind book an accessible read, as anyone whom studies ecology will of course studied aspects of evolution by natural selection and natural sexual selection.
wiki ""The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture is a 1992 book edited by the anthropologists Jerome H. Barkow and John Tooby and the psychologist Leda Cosmides.[1] First published by Oxford University Press, it is widely considered the foundational text of evolutionary psychology (EP), and outlines Cosmides and Tooby's integration of concepts from evolutionary biology and cognitive psychology, as well as many other concepts that would become important in adaptationist research.""

36,ecology,Future career prospects in related fields,"TL:DR below

So I am currently an Ecology/Evolutionary Biology student at a pretty decent research university in the US. My dream job is to be a wildlife biologist for a state, federal agency, or even NGO. I really want to be in the field doing hands-on projects as much as possible.

 My minor is wildlife and Fisheries science but since I've started taking more wildlife classes I really feel like maybe I should switch my major to Wildlife and Fisheries since it seems more in tune with what I want to be doing in the future. I'm planning on getting a master's degree in Wildlife no matter what my undergraduate is in. But I have had people tell me that with Ecology I'll get ""the more rigorous scientific background"". And I enjoy learning about Ecology too, but I don't want to be stuck in a lab, behind a desk, or in academia.

So I guess I'm looking for advice here. How many ecologists are out there doing the more hands-on projects in the field or working in the capacity I've referenced above? But on the other hand will a degree in Wildlife and Fisheries leave me unemployed? 

(Also my university apparently has one of the top undergraduate programs in WFS)

It is unpaid so I have to continue to keep my retail job. 

While I was applying for grad school, the store I work at was short staffed and they asked a lot of me throughout the window to apply, so I feel like I have not done as good as I should have on my applications since I was focusing too much on my job.

I would very much like to get out of working retail once and for all, and with the looming possibility that I will not get into a good grad school program it seems more important than ever.

I have not had much luck in finding jobs in this field that do not need at least a Masters. I have friends in archaeology that do seasonal field work for projects but do not know if such a thing exists in ecology, or where to begin looking for these types of jobs.

Abstract: Soils are currently leaching out dissolved organic matter (DOM) at an increasing pace due to climate and land use change or recovery from acidification. The implications for stream biogeochemistry and food webs remain largely unknown, notably the metabolic balance (biotic CO2 emissions) and carbon cycling between autotrophs and bacteria. We increased by 12% the flux of DOM in a stream for three weeks to mimic a pulse of natural DOM supply from soils rich in organic matter. We were able to track its fate into the food web through the use of a before and after control impact experimental design and the addition of DOM with a distinctive Œ¥13C signature. We used whole‚Äêstream metabolism to quantify carbon fluxes. Both photosynthesis and heterotrophic respiration increased rapidly following C addition, but this was short lived, likely due to nutrient limitations. Carbon exchange between autotrophs and bacteria in the control stream accounted for about 49% of bacterial production and 37% of net primary production, under stable flow conditions. Net primary production relied partly (19% in the control) on natural allochthonous dissolved organic carbon via the CO2 produced by bacterial respiration, intermingling the green and brown webs. The preferential uptake of labile carbon by bacteria and excess bacterial CO2 relative to nutrients (N, P) for autotrophs shifted the reciprocal carbon exchange between bacteria and autotrophs to a predominantly one‚Äêway carbon flow from bacteria to autotrophs, increasing the C:N:P molar ratios of autotrophs, the latter likely to become less palatable to consumers. The bacterial response to sucrose addition shifted the metabolic balance toward heterotrophy increasing biotic CO2 emissions (+125%), shortened the average distance travelled by a molecule of organic matter (‚àí40%), and thus provided less organic matter of lower quality for downstream ecosystems. Even a small increase in labile dissolved organic matter supply due to climate and land use change could significantly alter in‚Äêstream carbon cycling, with large effects on stream food web and biogeochemistry in small streams draining catchments with soils rich in organic carbon.",1579497346

Abstract: Highly variable and synchronised production of seeds by plant populations, known as masting, is implicated in many important ecological processes, but how it arises remains poorly understood. The lack of experimental studies prevents underlying mechanisms from being explicitly tested, and thereby precludes meaningful predictions on the consequences of changing environments for plant reproductive patterns and global vegetation dynamics. Here we review the most relevant proximate drivers of masting and outline a research agenda that takes the biology of masting from a largely observational field of ecology to one rooted in mechanistic understanding. We divide the experimental framework into three main processes: resource dynamics, pollen limitation and genetic and hormonal regulation, and illustrate how specific predictions about proximate mechanisms can be tested, highlighting the few successful experiments as examples. We envision that the experiments we outline will deliver new insights into how and why masting patterns might respond to a changing environment.",1578886856

Abstract: Within the context of species distribution models, scrutiny arises from the choice of meaningful environmental predictors. Thermal conditions are not the sole driver, but are the most widely acknowledged abiotic driver of plant life within alpine ecosystems. We linked long‚Äêterm measurements of direct, plant‚Äêrelevant, near‚Äêsurface temperatures to plant species frequency. Across 47 sites located along environmental gradients within the Scandinavian mountain chain, the thermal preferences of 26 focal species of vascular plants, lichens, and bryophytes were explored. Based on partial least‚Äêsquares regression, we applied a relative importance analysis to derive inductively the thermal variables that were best related to a species‚Äô frequency. To discover potential seasonal variability of thermal controls, analyses were both differentiated according to meteorological season and integrated across the entire year. The pronounced interspecies and temporal variability of thermal constraints revealed the thermal niches were much more nuanced and variable than they have commonly been represented. This finding challenges us to present, interrogate, and interpret data representing these thermal niches, which seems to be required in order to move beyond purely probabilistic and correlative descriptions of species‚Äô range limits. Thus, this information will help improve predictions of species distributions in complex arctic‚Äêalpine landscapes.",1578283481

Abstract: The ongoing global change and the increased interest in macroecological processes call for the analysis of spatially extensive data on species communities to understand and forecast distributional changes of biodiversity. Recently developed joint species distribution models can deal with numerous species efficiently, while explicitly accounting for spatial structure in the data. However, their applicability is generally limited to relatively small spatial data sets because of their severe computational scaling as the number of spatial locations increases. In this work, we propose a practical alleviation of this scalability constraint for joint species modeling by exploiting two spatial‚Äêstatistics techniques that facilitate the analysis of large spatial data sets: Gaussian predictive process and nearest‚Äêneighbor Gaussian process. We devised an efficient Gibbs posterior sampling algorithm for Bayesian model fitting that allows us to analyze community data sets consisting of hundreds of species sampled from up to hundreds of thousands of spatial units. The performance of these methods is demonstrated using an extensive plant data set of 30,955 spatial units as a case study. We provide an implementation of the presented methods as an extension to the hierarchical modeling of species communities framework.",1577233615

60,ecology,Questions about career prospects with forestry and environmental science degree ( includes ecology as well).,"Hello everyone I am a forestry and environmental science graduate from Greece. I have already posted this in the forestry and environmental sciences subreddit.

University here is 5 years and our degree covers a lot of subjects, forestry, environmental sciences like ecology and so, since I am now a graduate I am completely lost on what to do. I am writing here because I am planning to leave Greece after doing a one year post graduate degree on ecology and forest management, to work or further study in Europe. Environmental sciences interest me a lot however I have no idea what job I will be doing or what to pursue as further studies as in university we were taught a lot of different subjects.

Forestry in Greece does not have many career prospects, a graduate can either work in the government which due to the economic crisis doesn't accept new employees easily and the pay is very low, or in private companies where again, it is very difficult to find a job and the pay is still low. A third option would be to go for further studies like a phd. From my limited understanding of how things work I think I would be really interested in something like that because I find it more interesting.

Again I am asking for advice here because it is certain that in order to find a job or a good further education I will have to leave Greece to study abroad. I have recently taken the c2 exams in French and I am waiting for the results by the end of January. I believe I have passed it. I am about to do my mandatory military service here which is 9 months and then I want to do a post graduate degree here which is a year. I will discuss this with my professors in the university, but I want to find information myself to have a general idea as for what I am looking for.

I have heard that good options abroad are the Netherlands, especially the Waneningen university, the rest of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

All in all I would like to know what are some career options with my degree and if I can do something like a phd. I have some very vague ideas of what I want to do. I have these thoughts about working in forest management as a researcher in national parks or something like that but I don't want to get carried away and be unrealistic. Also I would like to know how much different options pay to balance my life a little bit.

Abstract: Changing conditions may lead to sudden shifts in the state of ecosystems when critical thresholds are passed. Some well‚Äêstudied drivers of such transitions lead to predictable outcomes such as a turbid lake or a degraded landscape. Many ecosystems are, however, complex systems of many interacting species. While detecting upcoming transitions in such systems is challenging, predicting what comes after a critical transition is terra incognita altogether. The problem is that complex ecosystems may shift to many different, alternative states. Whether an impending transition has minor, positive or catastrophic effects is thus unclear. Some systems may, however, behave more predictably than others. The dynamics of mutualistic communities can be expected to be relatively simple, because delayed negative feedbacks leading to oscillatory or other complex dynamics are weak. Here, we address the question of whether this relative simplicity allows us to foresee a community's future state. As a case study, we use a model of a bipartite mutualistic network and show that a network's post‚Äêtransition state is indicated by the way in which a system recovers from minor disturbances. Similar results obtained with a unipartite model of facilitation suggest that our results are of relevance to a wide range of mutualistic systems.",1576473945

I've always wondered why animals don't freak out in times of danger such as when there is a predator chasing them, or something bad is about to happen.

If there's danger near by, they don't freak out like humans do, they just kind of take their sweet time, and chill there.

A herd of elk gets chased by a bear. Half of the time they run, but the other half they are just standing there, and half the herd is eating grass, WHILE being chased by a bear. Like if I was the animal, Id be running for my life.

It's a cosmic horror novella taking place in an abandoned theme park in Louisiana, modeled on the real life Six Flags New Orleans (abandoned since Katrina). The plot device to have characters there long term is that a small group of ecologists are studying the reclamation of the park by nature (I was inspired by the popular interest in this form 2009's ""Life After Humans"" documentaries).

I really need one of the characters to have a blacklight. Some google searches have shown blacklights being used in really hyperspecific studies, usually in entomology, of insects' reactions to blacklights.

However, is there a good reason an entomologist would have one in the field? The closest I've seen are some excerpts about mosquito field sampling methods -- but I have no idea how this would work. (I'd like to describe to the reader WHY this character has a blacklight in a believable way so it seems less plot-device-y, even though that's exactly what it is).

That's my main question. My other question is simply this: could anybody tell me what sorts of field work ecologists might do in a scenario like this?

Key words: Landscape age, glacial retreat, erosion, vegetation succession, substrate pH

Summary: Landscape age is the time that a landscape has been free of glaciers, which physically prevent suitable land area for vegetation growth. Younger landscapes have thin and rocky soils, steep slopes, and substrates with high cation concentrations (i.e., less acidic) that limit which vegetation types can grow. As the landscape ages, erosion and the accumulation of organic material causes the soil to thicken and become less rocky. Erosion also causes the landscape to become flatter and more uniform. The thicker soil with lower cation concentrations, more nutrients, and greater water availability allows for the succession of mosses and grasses into shrubs.

Abstract: Animal response to stressors such as harsh environmental conditions and demanding biological processes requires energy generated through increased mitochondrial activity. This results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vitro and some in vivo studies suggest that oxidative damage of DNA caused by ROS is responsible for telomere shortening. Since telomere length is correlated with survival in many vertebrates, telomere loss is hypothesised to trigger cellular ageing and/ or to reflect the harshness of the environment an individual has experienced. To improve our understanding of stress‚Äêinduced telomere dynamics in non‚Äêhuman vertebrates, we analysed 109 relevant studies in a meta‚Äêanalytical framework. Overall, the exposure to possible stressors was associated with shorter telomeres or higher telomere shortening rate (average effect size = ‚àí0.16 ¬± 0.03). This relationship was consistent for all phylogenetic classes and for all a priori‚Äêselected stressor categories. It was stronger in the case of pathogen infection, competition, reproductive effort and high activity level, which emphasises their importance in explaining intraspecific telomere length variability and, potentially, lifespan variability. Interestingly, the association between stressor exposure and telomeres in one hand, and oxidative stress in the other hand, covaried, suggesting the implication of oxidative stress in telomere dynamics.",1575864390

3,ecology,How would the reintroduction of red wolves effect the south east?,"Hi, I am not an ecologist, nor do I have any significant ecological knowledge. That said, I would like to discuss what the impact of the reintroduction of the nearly extinct red wolf (Cainis rufus) would have on the south east. I am from Alabama and I see the utter destruction that the overpopulation of deer, wild hogs, and nutria have on people here. Specifically farmers and hunters are affected by the hogs, but everyone is at risk of deer via collisions with cars. Repopulating the area with a predator would seem to me to be a solution to the overpopulation of these prey animals. 

Now, even in my limited knowledge on this subject I understand that I am certainly overlooking the impact of a new top level predator being thrown into an ecosystem, but that‚Äôs why I want to talk about it here: I want to learn. I hear talk of people seeing mountain lions in my area of Alabama already so it seems like maybe a predator is on its way in already. I also know that red wolves were introduced to Tennessee in the past fairly unsuccessfully so I want to know why that failed. Thanks for taking the time to read this!",1575830973

Abstract: Climate change has caused widespread shifts in species‚Äô phenology, but the consequences for population and community dynamics remain unclear because of uncertainty regarding the species‚Äêspecific drivers of phenology and abundance, and the implications for synchrony among interacting species. Here, we develop a statistical model to quantify inter‚Äêannual variation in phenology and abundance over an environmental gradient, and use it to identify potential drivers of phenology and abundance in co‚Äêoccurring species. We fit the model to counts of 10 butterfly species with single annual generations over a mountain elevation gradient, as an exemplar system in which temporally limited availability of biotic resources and favorable abiotic conditions impose narrow windows of seasonal activity. We estimate parameters describing changes in abundance, and the peak time and duration of the flight period, over ten years (2004‚Äì2013) and across twenty sample locations (930‚Äì2,050 m) in central Spain. We also use the model outputs to investigate relationships of phenology and abundance with temperature and rainfall. Annual shifts in phenology were remarkably consistent among species, typically showing earlier flight periods during years with warm conditions in March or May‚ÄìJune. In contrast, inter‚Äêannual variation in relative abundance was more variable among species, and generally less well associated with climatic conditions. Nevertheless, warmer temperatures in June were associated with increased relative population growth in three species, and five species had increased relative population growth in years with earlier flight periods. These results suggest that broadly coherent interspecific changes to phenology could help to maintain temporal synchrony in community dynamics under climate change, but that the relative composition of communities may vary due to interspecific inconsistency in population dynamic responses to climate change. However, it may still be possible to predict abundance change for species based on a robust understanding of relationships between their population dynamics and phenology, and the environmental drivers of both.",1575260585

36,ecology,Could mass-extinctions be caused by an long-lasting equilibrium rather than by a large scale event,"Roughly speaking, by ""large scale event"" I mean something like changing climate, asteroid striking the earth, large supervolcano erupting... etc.

By ""long-lasting equilibrium"" I mean nature being allowed to ""take it's course"" without any large scale events affecting it over a short span of time.

It seems that most of our assumptions right now are based on the idea that a large scale event will cause an extinction, however, there is no strong correlation.

We can roughly point to an asteroid impact that might have caused dinosaurs to die, but most other mass extinctions don't seem to have an obvious cause. Still, when people talk about a cause they usually talk about a large scale event.

However, wouldn't a long-lasting equilibrium also result in a mass-extinction, especially considering the way we define species on a historical scale is mainly by the fossil record, so a lot of small variations are lost. 

A long-lasting equilibrium might well result in differences that are observable in the fossil record dying out since, under the same conditions, evolution might optimize towards the same things. Naturally, this wouldn't mean all things evolve to be the same, since the environment of a species is mostly a function of the behavior of other species and the behavior of a species affects the environment in ways that propagate into the whole.

But it still seems to me like the assumption that the long-term (think 100k years, not 10 minutes) consequences of large scale events ought to be extinctions. It would seem much more likely that they would result in over-diversity, as certain well entranched niches die off and get replaced, a replacement which is likely not ""as optimized"" as the thing it replaced, thus leaving more room for competition.",1575197435

What are your thoughts on people who use terms like ""higher"" vs ""lower"" organisms? It vaguely reminds me of people who also call things like corals ""primitive"" vs humans ""advanced."" I've always thought those terms were anthropocentric at best, and reflective of an inaccurate bias in scientific study at worst. The only things that are literally primitive are the fossils that show actual early life, and most organisms are pretty well adapted/optimized for their habitats. 

I've always thought that the most ""ecologically correct"" way to describe these organisms were terms like ""simple"" or ""complex"". Even that feels a little biased to me because which still feels weird to me, because there are probably levels of complexity we can't imagine yet. ""Basal"" and ""derived"" also feels weird.

Abstract: Understanding how stochastic fluctuations in the environment influence population dynamics is crucial for sustainable management of biological diversity. However, because species do not live in isolation, this requires knowledge of how species interactions influence population dynamics. In addition, spatial processes play an important role in shaping population dynamics. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of how these different factors act together to shape patterns of abundance across space within and among species. Here, we present a new analytical model for understanding patterns of covariation in space between interacting species in a stochastic environment. We show that the correlation between two species in how they experience the same environmental conditions determines how correlated fluctuations in their densities would be in the absence of competition. In other words, without competition, synchrony between the species is driven by the environment, similar to the Moran effect within a species. Competition between the two species causes their abundances to become less positively or more negatively correlated. The same strength of competition has a greater negative effect on the correlation between species when one of them has a more variable growth rate than the other. In addition, dispersal or other movement weakens the effect of competition on the interspecific correlation. Finally, we show that movement increases the distance over which the species are (positively or negatively) correlated, an effect that is stronger when the species are competitors, and that there is a close connection between the spatial scaling of population synchrony within a species and between species. Our results show that the relationships between the different factors influencing interspecific correlations in abundance are not simple linear ones, but this model allows us to disentangle them and predict how they will affect population fluctuations in different situations.",1574646049

one thing i havent given much thought to, however, is how do i approach interviewers? Now, ive worked retail all my adult life and they usually like you to be very clean cut and hyper formal, but i went to an interview for an internship a few years ago (which i bombed, turns out internships *aren't* for freshman with no understanding of ecology lol) but i showed up in ironed and very well creased slacks and a dress shirt with a tie. and the interviewers kind of looked at me like i was at the wrong interview. at one point the woman in charge even said: ""you are aware that you are going to be spending the whole summer outside, right?""

which brings me to the question, how should i present myself for an interview with, say, a state park or local wildlife refuge? how formal is too formal? should i really worry too much about my haircut?

another issue that i have is that I've recently come out as MtF trans, and i havent started medically transitioning yet, but at the moment ive started growing my hair out. my appearance right now is just a man withclong hair, is long hair acceptable in this field? and would i experience any discrimination based on my gender-identity much later on when i do try to pass as a woman?

This is a follow-up about potential job paths outside academia for ecology majors. The list below comes from [Cheeky Scientist](https://cheekyscientist.com/), which is an organization you may want to look at for learning industry transition skills (they offer a free manual you can ask for that goes into more detail about each of these roles, and there's quite a bit of free content online from them too). If the main website scares you off, don't fret. It's a legit training and networking resource. It does cost money to join and there's a honest conversation about whether that's a good investment or not (opinions can vary).

I'd also highly recommend reading this blog post when thinking about life after school: [The Financial Reality of Being a Broke Wildlife Biologist](https://www.gosciencefinance.com/financial-reality-broke-biologist/)

Am not here to crush anyone's dream, but I do think everyone studying ecology deserves a full understanding of the job market and the supply vs. demand for trained ecology research professionals. It's a competitive and often low-paying career path. Many people still carve out successful careers, but it can also be a real fight to find steady, gainful employment. 

That said, training as an ecologist also makes you quite valuable in many other fields, and here's forty of them for you to have on your mind. Not all of these are the best fit for ecology per se, but the message is - there is a wide, wide world out there and plenty of paths to consider. Happy hunting!

I am a first year ecology and evolutionary biology PhD student in a lab that is primarily focused on community ecology / eco-evo dynamics / above- &amp; belowground linkages and PSF. I LOVE my advisor. She is very highly regarded in the department, has been at the university for a decade, and is a genuinely amazing human being that I am already benefiting immensely from working with.

I should note that my bachelor's degree is not in EEB, so when I applied to grad schools, I applied with a diverse range of labs that worked with everything from plants to fish. I know this isn't an ideal approach, but I was genuinely interested in everything, having no predispositions to any ecological system/study. So when I met my advisor and was genuinely (vaguely) interested in the lab's work, and saw how well we connected and the logistical fit worked with my fiance and I, I jumped at the opportunity.

So now here's the issue: After taking a semester's worth of general EEB courses, and diving into the current EEB literature, I think I am much more interested in behavioral ecology than I am in PSF/working with plants.

Sigh - Road block?

So my question to all of you:

1) Do I wait this out, give it more time than the mere one semester that has passed, stick with the lab that I am in and with the professor that I adore, and see what evolves (lol joke intended)?

or

2) Go with this feeling, explore it more by looking throughout the department to see if I would fit anywhere else, and ultimately play more with the idea of leaving my lab?

DID ANYONE ELSE FACE THESE FEELINGS?!

I feel like since I came in without a real connection to any system/questions, I really just told myself that anything would work. Which, honestly, could still totally be true. My intention for getting my PhD in EEB is to learn as much as I possibly can about our dynamic world, set myself up for my future as an ecologist, and to challenge myself. (Obviously, there is MUCH more to this statement that I would be happy to expand upon, but for the sake of time...). I'm just feeling kind-of bogged down with my current research in my lab, but when I think about, say, the interactions between members of a hyena family, I am so excited! 

Is this just a ""grass is greener"" effect occurring? Or should I listen to these feelings?

Any advice is so greatly appreciated. And I would be happy to expand upon any of the previous statements for more clarity. Thank you, thank you, thank you in advance.

Abstract: Locally, plant species richness supports many ecosystem functions. Yet, the mechanisms driving these often‚Äêpositive biodiversity‚Äìecosystem functioning relationships are not well understood. Spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients is one of the main hypothesized causes for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more biodiverse grasslands. Spatial resource partitioning occurs if species differ in where they acquire resources and can happen both above‚Äê and belowground. However, studies investigating spatial resource partitioning in grasslands provide inconsistent evidence. We present the results of a meta‚Äêanalysis of 21 data sets from experimental species‚Äêrichness gradients in grasslands. We test the hypothesis that increasing spatial resource partitioning along vertical resource gradients enhances ecosystem functioning in diverse grassland plant communities above‚Äê and belowground. To test this hypothesis, we asked three questions. (1) Does species richness enhance biomass production or community resource uptake across sites? (2) Is there evidence of spatial resource partitioning as indicated by resource tracer uptake and biomass allocation above‚Äê and belowground? (3) Is evidence of spatial resource partitioning correlated with increased biomass production or community resource uptake? Although plant species richness enhanced community nitrogen and potassium uptake and biomass production above‚Äê and belowground, we found that plant communities did not meet our criteria for spatial resource partitioning, though they did invest in significantly more aboveground biomass in higher canopy layers in mixture relative to monoculture. Furthermore, the extent of spatial resource partitioning across studies was not positively correlated with either biomass production or community resource uptake. Our results suggest that spatial resource partitioning across vertical resource gradients alone does not offer a general explanation for enhanced ecosystem functioning in more diverse temperate grasslands.",1573447955

26,ecology,Amateur data collection,"I find myself in a position where I travel a lot but I more or less lack a ""purpose"" in many of the places I go, I especially like traveling in nature, so I thought that maybe, since I like exploring remote places anyway, there's something useful I could do whilst at it in regards to collecting data about the biome of the places where I'm going.

I obviously know famous stories about people discovering various drugs (or sometimes precursors to such drugs) from soil samples and such, but I'm pretty much lost as to how one would go about doing something like this, and whether or not collection/analyzing samples can help at all, or if there are plenty of exotic bacteria to be analyzed but a lack of lab time doing so.

There's the route of collecting data at the macro-scale, trying to identify new species and what not, but that seems to be rather... ahm, pointless to be honest. The definition of species is rather vague and even if  I stumble upon a random variation of {x} in the congo, there's not much to do other than saying ""Hey, there's this weird {x} in the congo that has leaves shaped like {y} unlike the common {x} that has leaves shaped like {z}"".

Then, obviously, there's the idea of monitoring patterns of movement and what not, but that seems pretty useless unless integrated in a larger study and it also seems rather invasive since it involves things like attaching trackers... so I'd rather not go down that route since it might just end up with me traumatizing a bunch of fish/birds to collect meaningless info.

Finally finding new extremophiles seems to be rather easy if you reach a new environment where they leave, but I doubt I have the budget or experience to explore the depths of the oceans or the more remote prats of the Shara dessert or the arctic.

So provided that you had some fine quality hiking equipment, the freedom to go anywhere within reason and around 20k to throw on equipment... what kind of data would you try to collect in order to add a tiny bit to humanity's cumulative understanding of nature ? Is data collection without a goal for said data a thing that anyone outside of academia does ? Could it be useful to anyone or will it just end up sitting on my hard-drive being about as pointless as the various photos I take ?",1573223176

31,ecology,Any ecologists here that are super passionate about gaming and/or game design? I'd love to hear your opinions and ideas.,"Hi everyone! Decade old redditor here, but new to the sub. 

I'm a [veteran game developer](https://www.pcgamer.com/informative-infinity-ward-animator-talks-fps-design-animations/) who is acting as a producer on a couple of titles for a large philanthropic group that's focused on tackling the issues of climate change. One of the titles is a mobile project and I'd love to hear from some of the experts (sure, even the arm-chair experts) on what you think could make a compelling mobile game, based around ecology. 

The idea around this project is very loosely formed, but I'm thinking something along the following lines. As we've seen with games like Farmville and other more modern mobile projects, people will play a 'game' even if it's nothing more than a dopamine hook with no important decisions at all. Despite people realizing that Farmville was a game whose success was completely based off of logging in as frequently as possible, people still decided to play it. While Farmville is no longer very popular, that same theory behind the game design has heavily carried over into more modern titles.   


But what if you had a game like Farmville, except every single animal and plant on your farm represented actual plants, food, or crops that were donated to a poor village in a 3rd world country? For example, there's a non-profit called [Heifer International](https://www.heifer.org/gift-catalog/animals/index.html?msource=KIK1K19BS0001&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI4dqah7nZ5QIVhobACh17xACiEAAYASAAEgLt3fD_BwE). Instead of just donating money, you actually go on the website and purchase various good or animals like chickens, goats, sheep, rabbits, honey bees, pigs, etc...In theory, the developers and publisher would work alongside a non-profit like this. A major issue with this is the fact that it would take a whole lot of ad watching for a non-paying player to even get their first chicken in their farm. Luckily, trees, saplings and seeds are much cheaper than alpacas.

What I'm envisioning is a game where you build out a bio dome. Inside that bio dome are actual plants and trees that represent the actual trees that have been planted due to you buying the game. As you build at your bio dome, it starts attracting specials of animals that now start living in your biodome. They start off as seeds, but over time grow into full trees (much faster than the real ones you planted). Different types of plants or trees could attract different type of animals and effect the environment in different ways.  What would you do in your biodome? One idea could be sort of a Pokemon Snap or camera based game, where you're trying to get really good shots of these animals. There's different rarities of animals, from a common squirrel to getting extinct animals to show up.  It could be interesting to factor in other aspects of ecology and their relationship to one another.   


As people who actually know a lot about ecology, what could you envision being interesting that is associated with the above ideas? If you could build an ecology based game, what mechanics would you think are interesting?  


Thanks all!",1573176717
32,ecology,"Opinion editorial about clean water stuff (thoughts or improvements, etc feel free )","Clean water is very essential to people‚Äôs health and quality of life. The quality of life suffers when seafood dwindle, and water recreational activities such as swimming, fishing, and boating, are effected by polluted waters. It is important that businesses reduce pollution to be able to operate sustainability both environmentally and fiscally. It must be balanced also with businesses too for which clean water is essential for maximum fiscal health. 

Just as there is a national coalition of companies banding together to help the environment specifically in the fashion industry, for example the Sustainable Apparel Coalition which includes the following clothing brands: Aritzia, Columbia Sportswear Company, L.L. Bean, patagonia, lululemon. These companies have collaborated to build the High Index, a standardized supply chain measurement tool to understand the environmental and social impacts of their businesses. Likewise, there could be formed a national coalition for the promotion and business interests side for water pollution in America., in addition to existing coalitions on the state and regional level. The proposed organization, ‚ÄúClean Water Coalition‚Äù would unite business interests with a vested interest in appealing to American customers who care ‚Äúa great deal‚Äù about water pollution in America‚Äî which in 2017, was over half of all Americans ‚Äî as well as including under its umbrella other businesses such as real estate (a new study done by the Cape Cod Commission showed nitrogen water pollution negatively effected home values, where a 1% decline in water quality led to an average loss in home value of 0.61%‚Äù). 

The Coalition would spur the pace of water innovations and adoptions of high quality technological solutions to solve industries most pressing problems. The Coalition would collaborate to raise the awareness in the national discussion of the value of clean water. The Coalition would also promote the creation of clean water jobs, for example to maintain the flailing fishing industries, as due to water pollution many regions have seen falling populations of fish and other seafood. And in the future, it could be heard that people were no longer ‚Äúgreatly worried‚Äù about water pollution in America. In fact, why couldn‚Äôt it be that there is no more water pollution in America. That would be ideal. 

Ultimately such solutions are possibly predicated on a system where there is a little semblance of corporations being able to affect governmental policy. The influence of corporations on government policy in terms of its weight relative to the influence of the American voter ideally would be minimized though not eradicated. There is room to listen to corporations and promote American economy while ensuring that all American voters have a say in a democratic system. The pernicious influence of lobbying in general on the average American‚Äôs ability to get things done is whole other topic but there are tremendous strides and legislations being passed in many states to create an even better democracy here and set an example for abroad as well. Whether or not a national coalition of this sort would be useful even if, for example, lobbying itself was drastically minimized, I believe there is a case for it. When American corporations collaborate for the better of the environment, great strides in the betterment of everyday quality life in the areas of clean water, air, public parks, and so on are achievable.",1573165330

https://preview.redd.it/uv8vnz1qgvw31.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41a75298dec5296f44084355d57f16b61d450820

Recently the Danish authorities have finally agreed the construction of the part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. It should run along the country‚Äôs continental shelf southeast of Bornholm on the bed of the Baltic Sea.

However, this decision may become fateful for the whole ecosystem through its irreversible environmental impact. Basically, the case is not the Nord Stream 2 itself, but the chemical munitions on the seabed along the pipe route, which may make it impossible to use the water area for fishing and recreational services.

This threat has not become a surprise for Russia which for a decade sought ways to circumvent the chemical munitions dumping sites east of Bornholm. However, the lack of verifiable information about the precise sites of chemical deposits made these attempts futile.

Hazardous waste on the seabottom includes adamsite, diphenylchloroarsine, and mustard gas, which appeared there back in Soviet times, when they were dumped in cases by ships on their way to designated area. The sea drift carried them far beyond this area which resulted in munition cases found in unexpected locations not only on the Bornholm coasts but even in Sweden. Still the location of the entire arsenal in the Baltic Sea remains unknown.

Official documents of that time stated that in 1946, four ships carrying 15.000 tonnes of dangerous cargo were sunk nearby the Bornholm coast along with 8 tonnes of chemicals dumped to the east of the island. Their dumping was complicated with the poor visibility and weather conditions which meant the chemical agents were dropped outside the designated areas.

Another source of pollution was 69.000 tonnes of shells with tabun (nerve gas) and phosgene which appeared in water of the so-called Small Belt near Bornholm after the Wermacht\\u2019s decision to dump it in 1945. The new episode of contamination was provoked by development in chemical weapons, turning them from mustard-based to those containing sarin. As a result, out of date munitions were dumped in Baltic, Kara, Okhotsk, and Barents Seas without clear indication of pollution areas.

According to the report of the Special Working Commission on Chemical Weapons Utilization of the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM CHEMU) of 1994, all the attempts to take chemical weapons from the seabed are not only feasible but even dangerous and therefore unacceptable. Another document, The 2009 Nord Stream Espoo Report: Key Issue Paper Munitions: Conventional and Chemical states that the only way to dispose of the dangerous residue on the seabed is their explosion, however, the risk of contamination of far wider areas is too high as well as the threat of the rise of toxic substances into the surface layers of the sea with subsequent pollution and harm to marine organisms seems inevitable.

Moreover, that is the construction of the Nord Stream 2 that may result in violation of integrity or even detonation of the munitions, making the worst scenario possible. Though even successful construction of the Nord Stream 2 does not guarantee the further safety of its operation since vibration may cause unpredictable consequences if the pipe lies over dumping locations. By the way, the one or two molecules of mustard gas only may result in pronounces mental and physical deviations for the affected organism.",1572961562

Abstract: 

Across landscapes, shifts in species composition often co‚Äêoccur with shifts in structural or abiotic habitat features, making it difficult to disentangle the role of competitors and environment on assessments of patch quality. Using over two decades of rodent community data from a long‚Äêterm experiment, we show that a small, ubiquitous granivore (Chaetodipus penicillatus) shifted its use of different experimental treatments with the establishment of a novel competitor, C. baileyi. Shifts in residency, probability of movement between patches, and the arrival of new individuals in patches altered which treatment supported the highest abundances of C. penicillatus. Our results suggest that the establishment of a new species worsened the quality of the originally preferred treatment, likely by impacting resource availability. Paradoxically, the presence of the new species also increased C. penicillatus‚Äô use of the less preferred treatment, potentially through shifts in the competitive network on those plots.",1572840304

The first comparison of the distribution and ecology of the two species of Macrourus in the Ross Sea region is presented. The number of rays in the left pelvic fin and number of rows of teeth in the lower jaw allowed the two species to be distinguished both in the laboratory and by scientific observers at sea. The species were sympatric by depth (900‚Äì1 900 m) and by spatial area within CCAMLR Subareas 88.1 and 88.2. There was a small but significant increase in the proportion of M. whitsoni caught with depth. Catches of females of both species exceeded that of males (especially for M. caml). Macrourus caml grows slower, reaches a larger size, lives longer and is heavier for a given length than M. whitsoni. Female sexual maturity is reached at shorter length in M. caml than M. whitsoni but at a similar age (50% sexual maturity at 16 y).

Abstract:

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species assesses the extinction risk of nearly 100 000 species, including documentation of a range map, habitat, and elevation data for each species. Numerous recent studies have matched these habitat and elevation data with remotely sensed land cover and elevation datasets to map AOH (also known as extent of suitable habitat) within the range of each species. AOH differs from the two spatial metrics used in the IUCN Red List criteria for extinction risk assessment: EOO (minimum convex polygon around all present native occurrences of a species); and AOO (area actually occupied by a species). AOH can be of value in locating target areas for species-specific field surveys, assessing the proportion of a species‚Äô habitat within protected areas, and monitoring habitat loss and fragmentation.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species includes assessment of extinction risk for 98 512 species, plus documentation of their range, habitat, elevation, and other factors. These range, habitat and elevation data can be matched with terrestrial land cover and elevation datasets to map the species‚Äô area of habitat (AOH; also known as extent of suitable habitat; ESH). This differs from the two spatial metrics used for assessing extinction risk in the IUCN Red List criteria: extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). AOH can guide conservation, for example, through targeting areas for field surveys, assessing proportions of species‚Äô habitat within protected areas, and monitoring habitat loss and fragmentation. We recommend that IUCN Red List assessments document AOH wherever practical.",1572384714

98,ecology,Starting grad school in 2021 at age 25. Would doing a masters first and then a PhD be a terrible mistake? (I'd finish the PhD at age 32-35),"I'll try and keep this as brief as possible.

Been passionate about wildlife, the ocean, and science for my whole life.  I have a bachelors in biology and I've done a ton of fieldwork (paid and unpaid) and I currently am a zebrafish genetics lab tech and fish husbandry person.  I like my job and my boss and it is a 2 year position, so I don't want to go back on my word and leave early.  Also, I'd really like a recommendation letter from him for grad school, so I don't want to burn bridges.  So, the earliest I can start grad school is 2021, and I will be 25 at that time.

I'm 80% sure that I'd like to do a PhD and pursue a faculty position or work as a government research scientist.  I'm aware of how incredibly hard it can be to get these jobs, and I think I have a pretty good understanding of the day-to-day life the PIs/scientists live.  I have a lot of research experience and I enjoy the research process, although I haven't done the kind of writing that PIs/lead scientists spend a lot of their time doing.

However, committing to a 5-7 year PhD (USA) makes me really nervous.  My main concerns are:

* What if I don't like research as much as I think I do, but don't have any other career options after getting a PhD?

* I have a relatively wide area of interest.  What if I don't like being highly specialized?

* What if I simply can't get to where I would like to be, career-wise?There are a lot of PhDs awarded and not that many PhD-level positions.


So, I'm thinking it could be a good idea to do a masters degree first.  This could: 

* show me a side of research that I haven't experienced as an undergrad/tech, and help confirm that this is actually the route I want to take
* allow me to narrow my research focus, and do really great work and get into a better PhD program then what I can do now.
* give me time to learn more relevant skills, and get ""in"" with local organizations by collaborating with them or volunteering.  All things that would set me up to be a better candidate for a MsC level ecologist job with state or local govt., or a non-profit or something along those lines, *if* I decide not to continue and do a PhD.

Basically, I could do the masters and set myself up really well to either get into a great PhD position, or move into an MsC level scientist position if I decide not to do the PhD.  (I'm aware these jobs are also hard to get)

The problem is, if I do the masters first, and then a PhD after, I'll be 33-35 when I finish the PhD, plus years more as a post-doc (assuming I do it in the USA... another option here is do the PhD in Australia where programs are shorter)

Is this a terrible idea?  Should I just go into the PhD and say forget the masters?  Or would finishing a PhD at 33-35 not be the end of the world?

I'm honestly really lost here and feel like I'm getting lots of conflicting answers from the few people I feel like I can talk to about this, so I thought I'd reach out to the internet for some advice.  Thanks in advance!",1571879880

4,ecology,How to make yourself more competitive for a Ph.D while working on your M.S.,"I'm starting my BS/MS program this year and I'm worried that the experience I gain will not be enough to make me a competitive Ph.D student. My project focuses on stable isotope analysis on seal whiskers, and my thesis advisor is telling me that it will take a year to process the whiskers and the next year just to work on the paper.

I took the project because it's my best shot at publishing a first-author paper, it's focuses on a test subject I love, and my thesis advisor has been my favorite professor since I started as an undergraduate freshman. It honestly feels like a dream come true.

That aside, I'm worried that this isn't enough experience. I am unable to conduct the fieldwork for the project because the samples have already been collected. I feel like the opportunity could possibly only teach me how to write a paper and how to do stable isotope analysis. I want to have as much experience as possible for my masters, and while my advisor says there might be opportunities for field work and contributions to other projects, it's not a guarantee.

I've been in four other labs for shorter amounts of time during my undergrad, so I definitely have learned different skills, but I worry it's not enough because I was only in each of these labs for a couple of months. Am I worrying too much?

TL;DR

Abstract:

Fungal diseases threaten natural and man‚Äêmade ecosystems. Chytridiomycota (chytrids) infect a wide host range, including phytoplankton species that form the basis of aquatic food webs and produce roughly half of Earth's oxygen. However, blooms of large or toxic phytoplankton form trophic bottlenecks, as they are inedible to zooplankton. Chytrids infecting inedible phytoplankton provide a trophic link to zooplankton by producing edible zoospores of high nutritional quality. By grazing chytrid zoospores, zooplankton may induce a trophic cascade, as a decreased zoospore density will reduce new infections. Conversely, fewer infections will not produce enough zoospores to sustain long‚Äêterm zooplankton growth and reproduction. This intricate balance between zoospore density necessary for zooplankton energetic demands (growth/survival), and the loss in new infections (and thus new zoospores) because of grazing was tested empirically. To this end, we exposed a cyanobacterial host (Planktothrix rubescens) infected by a chytrid (Rizophydium megarrhizum) to a grazer density gradient (the rotifer Keratella cf. cochlearis). Rotifers survived and reproduced on a zoospore diet, but the Keratella population growth was limited by the amount of zoospores provided by chytrid infections, resulting in a situation where zooplankton survived but were restricted in their ability to control disease in the cyanobacterial host. We subsequently developed and parameterized a dynamical food‚Äêchain model using an allometric relationship for clearance rate to assess theoretically the potential of different‚Äêsized zooplankton groups to restrict disease in phytoplankton hosts. Our model suggests that smaller‚Äêsized zooplankton may have a high potential to reduce chytrid infections on inedible phytoplankton. Together, our results point out the complexity of three‚Äêway interactions between hosts, parasites, and grazers and highlight that trophic cascades are not always sustainable and may depend on the grazer's energetic demand.",1571625725

Abstract:

Diel variability in nutrient concentrations is common but not universal in aquatic ecosystems. Theoretical models of photoautotrophic systems attribute the absence of diel uptake variation to nutrient scarcity, such that diel variability in nutrient uptake disappears as nutrients become limiting. We tested this prediction in a mesocosm experiment, by exposing benthic algal communities to a range of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations and recording the rates of uptake during both day and night. We found that higher concentrations of N produced diel variability in uptake and that the difference between the day and night total mass uptakes approximately equaled N demand for observed primary production as seen in other studies. At lower concentrations of N, uptake rates during the day and night were indistinguishable. These results are the first empirical evidence to imply that diel nitrate patterns in streams and rivers indicate a release from N limitation and offer a new way to assess nutrient limitation.",1571025778

Anyway, this week's article is 'High rates of primary production in structurally complex forests' from Christopher M. Gough, Jeff W. Atkins, Robert T. Fahey, and Brady S. Hardiman

61,ecology,Career Advice,"Hi All,

I have seen several posts about undergraduate studies and future plans, but none have really answered my questions. 

This year I will be finishing my BS in Biology with a focus in Botany and Ecology (my university clumps everything into ""biology"", as in microbiology, molecular, botany, etc...) I have a 3.1 GPA, but my major GPA is around 3.3, this is classes counting only towards my major such as bio and ecology classes. I would like to get a masters or PhD in ecology, however I'm not sure if I should just try to jump right into a grad program. I have been thinking about finding a job after my BS and get some real world experience, and then go into a grad program. People have told me to do either one, which I know people will also say on this post, but I just want to know people's personal experiences and their thoughts on this. Those who have told me to get a job first bring up the point that I'll get real world experience and that if I like the company I would be working for, I could then move up positions. People who have said to go right into a grad program just say that I wouldn't have to do it in the future, which could be nice.  I know that I have a pretty average GPA, but I also know that professors prefer those who have a decent GPA and experience in the field versus someone with a stellar GPA and no experience (at least that's what professors at my university have told me). 

Any thoughts on this? Sorry if this is poorly worded or makes no sense, I'm posting this before my 7:30 AM class. If you have any questions about what I mean, just let me know and I'll try to get back as soon as possible.",1570630592

\- trips to go to visit each-other (2 times every year) -&gt; -50kg CO2 / year

\- phone calls -&gt; 5???? CO2 / year

\- take a shower together -&gt; -10 l / day of water

would you help me find some good parameters, maybe even fun? and above all: how to calculate the kg of CO2 that each activity generates? there are databases, sites, other?

I know little about ecology, biology, or any of the natural or physical sciences.  I was telling some friends about this and one of them suggested I post here.

This was roughly eight years ago during high school, my parents' house is in new england and there a lot of chipmunks in the yard, they make nests in our stone fences and occasionally our wood piles.  During early summer I was outside and there was a chipmunk sitting on top of one of the rock fences, being very still, I thought I had made eye contact with it and stopped moving, it stayed where it was.  Things remained like this for around 15 seconds.  

At this point another chipmunk came out from a nearby crevice in the fence, and after approaching the original chipmunk over the course of maybe 5 seconds, ended up with its face in the original chipmunks rear, and judging from the motions its head was making it was doing something with its mouth.

The weirdest part was this went on for a good 5+ seconds, only then did the original chipmunk squeak, turn around and scurry away into the fence, the other chipmunk in pursuit.  I have no idea what all of that was, I don't even know how to google if oral sex among chipmunks is a known behavior.  Was this a form of grooming maybe?  

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: I don't know anything about animals and their behavior and saw what looked like one chipmunk eating out another chipmunk.  What did I see?  Thanks",1570153278

94,ecology,What % of the world production of soy actually goes to feed livestock?,"So i was watching this YouTube video and a guy stated something I never heard before.

He explained that 100% of the soy production is aimed at human consumption. However, after we extract what we need from the plant, the leftovers are refined and transformed into food for livestock.

0,ecology,Researchers: studying ecological theory amidst the biodiversity crisis,"I've been in a slump for the past month. I just started my MSc in an interdisciplinary program that does not have any 'pure' ecologists (as opposed to applied) and involves many social science components. This interdisciplinary program has many political ecologists and social scientists that work directly with environmental data and human communities, especially Indigenous communities. There are also many conservationists, which I now understand are more concerned with the social aspects of conservation rather than biological aspects. I was attracted to the program because I love the atmosphere and aggregation of environmentally conscious individuals doing important work, and I liked my supervisor's lab group -- note that my lab group does strictly ecology without a social component. But now I am having many doubts about my own interests and values.

Tomorrow many of us are going to a climate strike. Everybody here is so passionate and gung ho about stimulating conversation and action to counter climate change and environmental issues, and rightfully so, but I've never been in such a concentration of eco-conscious people. It is reassuring to see, but it is incredibly exhausting such that I think I am not cut out for this line of work. It hurts me to say this because I believe the biodiversity crisis among the biggest global issues, but it is so overwhelming to discuss let alone tackle the issue directly through my research. (I do my part to be sustainable in biking everywhere, reducing waste, supporting particular brands, etc., so I do not mean to say that climate change and global environmental issues are unworthy of my efforts.)

Prior to starting my MSc, I described several new species of mites from Brazil and studied hybridization between grass populations. I was in the Brazilian rainforest looking for bugs feeling, at the time, like my work was totally justified. In the lab, I would spend hours sorting out taxonomic information to identify things. It was so cool! But whenever I had to justify my research in a presentation or report, I struggled because I didn't think that these projects addressed the issue of biodiversity loss. Hence why my MSc is in applied ecology.

But now that I'm doing applied ecology, I seem to lack the natural curiosity that led me into ecology in the first place. It feels like 'here is a species in decline so let's go study it and treat it like its the centre of the universe'. There is little opportunity for me to explore my own interests. However, my dilemma is that I still believe the type of work that I'm doing is extremely important. So my heart says go study bugs in the rainforest and ecological theory (community assembly!!) but my mind says study something more directly related to your values (ie. more directly related to species extinctions and climate change). I seem unhappy regardless of which camp I'm in. I wish I could go back in time and select an MSc project that better united ecological theory and biodiversity loss (ie. functional trait-based approaches to conservation). (But there are still a million benefits that my current project provides, and I enjoy my time so far!)

Do you value 'pure' ecological research amidst the biodiversity crisis? Does anybody have similar thoughts to share? I'd be interested in hearing.

**tl;dr** I feel like research in 'pure ecology' doesn't address the biodiversity crisis directly enough, but I am not personally excited by research that directly addresses the biodiversity crisis. Do you have similar thoughts? Thanks for reading!",1569565658

I am certain that I want to get my PhD, however I do not know if I can even get into a good PhD program with my comparably sub par research experience. I feel like my CV may look fine enough for a MS program but not quite yet for a PhD program.

Due to open graduate student position opportunities (aligning with my research interests) at these two schools, I have been looking at Ohio State University and Penn State University. Could someone give me their brutally honest opinion on whether or not I should just go for a MS over a PhD and also my chances of getting into one of these schools' ecology or environmental science-related PhD programs?

Here is a run-down of what my experiences and other info looks like:

**Research**

* Research Assistant for one summer in a toxicology lab assisting with studies on mountain-top mining bioaccumulation in mayflies
* Undergraduate research for about a year (with a grant from my university's office of undergraduate research grant) with two other people (grad student and another undergrad) doing tests on mesocosms with floating islands and testing different methods to examine nutrient uptake potentials. Since I got the grant with my friend, the other undergrad, I don't know if I should list this on my CV as ""independent research""
* Independent undergraduate research one summer through a NSF REU program at a university. I designed my own project on mercury cycling in the St. Lawrence River, conducted the experiments, and presented at that university's conference
* No thesis experience, in case that affects anything

**Conference Experience**

* Just one conference at that university's research and creativity symposium

**Awards and GPA:**

* Best undergraduate oral presentation award
* Best undergraduate poster presentation in sustainability award
* Grant for $1,000 for the above project
* GPA: 3.91

**Teaching Experience**

* No TA experience, but I did teach environmental science to 8th graders for a few months

**Publications**

* No publications; my professor from my REU says I will be listed as a co-author for the paper his masters student is writing, but it won't be done until next May, and I apply to grad schools in December

Any honest feedback would be greatly appreciated! I feel as if my experiences are very mediocre and less compared to some of my peers who got into a PhD program have CVs full of conference experiences, research experiences, TA experiences, some publications, thesis experience, and many various scholarships. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but I just want to know if Ohio State or Penn State's environmental-related PhD program would see me as a competitive candidate.",1569350466

Everything in ecology interests me immensely, and I love learning all the different corners of the study. So far, all I‚Äôve come to is that I really enjoy community ecology.

44,ecology,Future ecologist's career prospects,"Hi. I'm hoping to graduate as Master of Biology within one year from now. I've taken a minor in Geology in my Bachelor, and chose Ecology, Biodiversity and Evolution instead of Molecular Biology and Physiology as my specialisation. 

More specifically I'm leaning towards terrestrial ecology and I'm doing my thesis on invasive plant species from a trait based framework.

I'm a bit worried about finding a job in my field, and I fear my grades will be too low to apply for a PhD.

So I have been thinking to diversify my programme a bit, and instead of choosing more ecologicy and evolution based course, going for 'molecular plant biology and biotechnology' and 'genome, proteome and metabolome analysis' to diversify more towards biochemistry. But I'm wondering whether this will make a significant difference in my career possibilities in the biochemistry/biotechnology sector. Do you think I should bother learning more about molecular biology/biotechnology or do you think it's not worth it if it's only 2 courses? 

In the other direction I think choosing the GIS course, combined with my minor in Geology, would be a solid choice.",1568506341

Wanted to discuss a general trend in this field. Below is a field position for a cool sounding job. Thing is, you're the lead field tech AND primary data analyst for the research project. Requires a master's degree. And it pays at most $55k, probably less.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been doing research ecology for four years now and I'm just completely burnt out. I've been asked to, at various times, do web development, write lab protocols, lead group meetings, write academic papers. Feels like I've had to learn the full jobs of 20 different people and I just can't take it anymore. I like variety and learning new things, but I just can't anymore. I can't learn multiple programming codes, statistics, people skills, administration. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the compensation for this role. I can't make $40K in my thirties and save for retirement unless I live with roommates to save on rent and eat beans for dinner.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just done. Time to bail for industry I think. I'm really sad and depressed and feeling hopeless and wondering if I'm crazy to be feeling this way? It's no-one's fault. Budgets are tight and all. I just feel jobs are starting to ask for too much and I'm scared and terrified for my well-being, and am wondering if the problem is me or the world?

36,ecology,Chernobyl-2: Radiation after the accident at the South Ukrainian NPP will overwhelm the Donbass and Crimea,"Power units at the South Ukrainian NPP in the Nikolaev region are on the verge of a terrible state of emergency - the steam generators of all three units are in pre-emergency condition, the Donbass Today correspondent reports referring to its own source at the nuclear power plant.

‚ÄúEmissions of activated water from the reactor circuit to the turbogenerator circuit, and through it to the environment, have sharply increased,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúHowever, instead of decreasing the capacity of nuclear reactors prescribed by the instructions in this case, the NNEGC Energoatom, on the contrary, is considering the possibility of increasing it, thereby creating the threat of a large-scale accident in which radiation pollution can reach Crimea, the DNI and the LPR‚Äù.

¬†Born in the 80s

The South Ukrainian NPP operates three power units with water-water reactors of the VVER-1000 series, built in the 1980s according to the design of JSC OKB Gidropress (Podolsk, Moscow Region). There are four steam generators in the reactor shop of each power unit. They consist of thousands of heat exchange tubes for pumping under high pressure the activated coolant of the first (reactor) circuit in order to transfer energy to the second (turbine-generating) circuit, through which steam containing no radioactive substances is supplied to the turbine.

But over time, under the influence of high temperature and pressure, as well as the corresponding chemical regime, defects develop in the heat transfer tubes, which leads to their overlap during the scheduled repair work carried out by the NPP specialists.

Approaching disaster

The source notes that the current regulation allows the use of steam generators with 10% of plugged pipes without any significant loss of power. At the same time, according to the available information, in 2012 the leadership of the South Ukrainian NPP, without coordination with JSC OKB Gidropress, arbitrarily decided on the possible operation of steam generators with 20% of the muffled heat transfer channels at all three power units. Currently, the technical condition of steam generators has deteriorated significantly, on some steam generators the number of plugged tubes is close to 30%, which is the maximum allowable indicator.

According to experts, the use of steam generators with 30% of the blocked heat exchange channels is still possible, but subject to a proportional decrease in the thermal power of the reactor, which will accordingly lead to a decrease in the productivity of the power plant. However, instead, the head unit of the South Ukrainian NPP - the NNEGC Energoatom Corporation - is considering the issue of increasing the thermal capacity of the reactor to 106% in order to ensure the growth of electricity production: this power plant provides electricity to Odessa, Nikolaev and Kherson regions by 95%.

In addition, the leadership of Ukraine made a strong-willed decision to switch the South Ukrainian NPP to the fuel of the American company Westinghouse. In July 2018, power unit No. 3 completely switched to alternative fuel, power units No. 1 and 2 are 50% loaded.

No forecasts

NPP specialists do not have the heat exchange parameters for new fuel, which makes it impossible to predict the parameters of the steam generators and the state of the heat transfer tubes, which has an extremely negative effect on the operation of both the steam generators and the operation of the NPP as a whole. An increase in the release of radioactive water into the environment is noted, which already leads to problems with the health of local residents and NPP personnel. In addition, the failure of the steam generator can lead to a serious technological accident, one of the main consequences will be a power outage in a number of regions of Ukraine.

Due to the rupture by Ukraine of economic relations with Russia, Ukrainian specialists are not able to replace steam generators, since this type of equipment is essentially unique and is being developed taking into account the characteristics of each specific reactor. In addition, the replacement of the steam generator provides for stopping the power unit for up to one year, which is unacceptable for the leadership of Ukraine due to the high load on the power units that generate about 2/3 of all electric energy in the country.

https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/08/08/critics-say-monsantos-spying-and-intimidation-operation-show-why-biotech-giant-needs

100 years ago, after the oil banker barons took over public credit, they took over public education and healthcare and corrupted them completely. Nuclear power was corrupted at least 60 years ago. The Rockefellers and Carnegies were the robber barons who started it with eugenics research and public libraries way back when books were a thing. Academics don't like to discuss academic fraud, so they call it a conspiracy. How much more proof do you need that we are destined to collapse if we don't disabuse the pigs proles and plebes of greed.

Nuclear power could have saved earth from us, instead all we got are depleted uranium bullets everywhere. We don't have time for inclusive points of privilege. We gotta do something that's real. We gotta stop believing in trips to Mars, transhumanism, 5G etc or earth dies.

There are 10,000 studies that say wifi and cell radiation harm life, yet we are putting 5G stations every 300 feet in cities. It's harming birds and bees. You don't need to be a scientist to know this, but you'll be labelled a conspiracist. To all my knowledge, this stuff is true.

Academics and scientists hate what I'm about to present to you. Here's a list of scientific and academic fraud. 

https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/

The reason for scientific and academic fraud is greed. The world is run by greedy pigs, plebes and proles. We have to tax the rich with a 100% private carbon tax that's paid 100% back to the lower 40% worldwide. James Hansen knows how to do this.

I like listening to Chomsky, he's smart and lulls me to sleep, but he's like 80 years old, and talking about ancient history. The revolution's been coming for 100 years.

I am a 1rst year masters student studying the effects Nitrogen deposition has on biogeochemistry (soil- microbial function, nutrients, CO2, N2O fluxes etc) and plants (biodiversity ‚Äî with invasive species component and growth). The study is funded by the National park service air resources division and is taking place in 3 National Park grasslands. 

Also, I did a pretty big experiment as an undergrad (I was a NSF REU which turned into a RA job) looking at the effects altered precipitation regimes (severe drought and delayed monsoon timing) has on belowground primary productivity and biogeochem. Here I learned how to write, went to conferences and I became pretty proficient with R so I was sort of ‚Äúahead of the game‚Äù when starting my MS. 

My advisor has been recommending I turn my MS into a phd and after my defending my proposal my committee wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how ‚Äúgreat I am‚Äù and that I should get a phd especially with given the magnitude of my experiment (there are other components to it including a lab incubation and P addition experiment). 

Doing a phd would extend my time in university for another 2 yrs.

I ultimately would love a job in as a government as an environmental scientist/ biologist but one reservation is that I want to stay in my city (which apparently is really hard to get by on). 

Gov agencies I know of in my area include EPA &amp; and USGS (from what I see is that these agencies ask for BS &amp; higher not specifically phd). 

The other route would be environmental scientist/ biologist for a consulting firm. We have 2 military bases in our region that regularly (from what I see on job postings online) look for biologist for natural resources and biologist (conservation) type positions (the ask for BS or MS preferred). Last resort would be working in a consulting firm for oil and gas industry (they usually ask for BS for scientist I-III).


So the big question is knowing that I don‚Äôt need a phd to get any of these positions: would getting a phd hurt or help my chances of getting these type of positions? If I have to start ‚Äúlower‚Äù ie. tech would they even hire me as a tech if I were to have a phd?

Swirl lessons simplify the R learning process by providing a guided, interactive experience through on-screen prompts and exercises which students answer directly in the RStudio console. Participants will learn the Swirl program, implement one existing Swirl lesson, contribute one new lesson and will leave the FMN with &gt;10 ready-to-use Swirl lessons covering diverse biology and data analysis concepts. **Apply by August 16.** Visit [https://qubeshub.org/groups/teaching\_r\_fmn\_2019](https://qubeshub.org/groups/teaching_r_fmn_2019)

**PROJECT EDDIE FMN: Teaching Quantitative Reasoning and Scientific Concepts with Data**

*Led by Andrew Haveles and Jen Klug*

Are you interested in teaching quantitative reasoning and looking to include data exploration in your classroom? Apply now to join the Project EDDIE FMN that will bring together faculty interested in implementing Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) teaching modules that address quantitative reasoning and scientific concepts using environmental data.

Project EDDIE modules address quantitative reasoning and scientific topics spanning environmental disciplines (e.g., ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, climate change, and environmental sciences) with a flexible structure to fit all teaching situations. Participants in this FMN will focus on how to use EDDIE modules in their undergraduate courses by participating in biweekly virtual sessions to collaborate with and support others in the network and receive mentoring. Participants will leave the FMN with modules available for implementation in multiple classroom settings, access to a network of peers, and an instructor story to share their experience about adapting and implementing an EDDIE module in their classroom. **Apply by August 16**.

15,ecology,Grad school for population ecology: how much math background should I have?,"I've been out of school for over a year now and the prospect of grad school gets more and more appealing the more I spend learning about ecology. I've been doing tech field positions while learning R + GIS and reading ecology and I'm realizing how much I wish I had ignored the pre-med/vet craze in undergrad. I have a decent background in basic ecology  and some biostats, but the majority of my coursework was in organismal bio, molec cell bio, physiology, and chem, all of which I lack much interest in. 

Lately I've been fascinated by the population and community ecology side of consbio--particularly as it relates to predator-prey ecology--and the modeling involved in it. I can imagine myself doing graduate work in that direction but the problem is I feel terribly under-equipped for the stats and math required for that kind of work. I took calculus in high school and slogged through it, thereafter taking no more math except for the biostats course I took. Now that I have motivation to learn math, I'm super interested in brushing up. I've been reading ""A Biologist‚Äôs Guide to Mathematical Modeling in Ecology and Evolution"" and reviewing the calculus required for it, but I still feel too far behind.

In an ideal world, I'd love to work through the whole Khan Academy math curriculum from basic geometry/trig/precalc (had math phobia before college as well) through calculus and then take linear algebra, multivariable calc, diff eq, probability, and maybe proofs, but of course that would take a ridiculous amount of time/effort/money. I'm already kind of booked trying to use R and QGIS to analyze some old data a previous professor gave me, and I imagine my resources would be better spent actually getting an ArcGIS Pro class/cert under my belt and doing data analysis projects in future seasonal positions. 

Am I overestimating the amount of math I'll need for the field I'm interested in? I imagine one could get through a masters concentrated on population ecology without fully appreciating/understanding the math involved, but I don't love the idea of blindly plugging and chugging the stats/math (which I understand may be a dumb concern). Would taking a few years of math rehab hurt my chances of getting into grad school?

Anyway, if anyone has any advice as to those questions or as to what options for getting GIS/data analysis experience are best for someone in my situation, I would really appreciate it.",1564334148
16,ecology,Bee's wraps | Envolturas de cera abeja,"You can use bee's wraps to cover your food such as fruits after washing, vegetables, wooden, glass, metal or plastic topers, although the latter is good to stop consuming as much as possible.

You can have an event and once you cut the cold ones or a salad you can use the bee's wraps because thanks to its beeswax attributes, you will keep your food naturally preserved for longer.

If at the end of your day you have leftover food, a half of tomato or avocado, a bread, you can wrap it with the Bee's wraps and do not worry if they stain, these are reusable you can wash them with mild dish soap and cold water, you only hang them for a few minutes and they will dry up being ready to continue being used for much longer.

Our products are manufactured with natural raw materials, beeswax from a neighboring town that is only supported by its small natural and pollution-free business, the fabrics used are 98% cotton a small producer from the coast of Veracruz, the recinas are obtained From Michoacan forests, the oils obtained from southern Mexico and all these raw materials are 100% biodegradable.

This means that you could bury them for a year or less and they could serve as fertilizer for your plants.

Life is short is an unquestionable truth, however leaving aside the culture to which we belong, we can try to do the least possible damage to our planet, while we are alive and that besides us it is the home of millions of people, animals, plants and ecosystems that depend on balance in the life cycle. Future generations that depend on us to have a better world.

There are thousands of ways to take care of the environment. Bee's wraps are the first step you can take in a way of life full of love for Mother Earth and all her offspring.

If you like what I share with you¬†today¬†or want to comment, give more examples of use, share that you will gladly be welcome.

Thanks for your time.

18,ecology,"[Question] Endangered species, and the effects of keeping them alive",From my uneducated limited understanding most animals that end up endangered are due to mostly human interference so we make them an endangered species to help prevent that human interference. It makes me wonder how often we interfere with nature and Darwinism due to the ecosystems weeding certain animals out and us interfering with that. Have there been any studies done on the impact of rebuilding population of endangered species. Could this potentially cause a feedback loop where we are preventing evolution of certain animals as when they become endangered we interfere instead of them evolving?,1564264730

The instillation is made to look like a gas station, but is in fact a museum to what the world in 2020 looked like, for visitors from the 2120s to see what the world/automobile/gasoline-based culture was like to people of the present day. Inside the gas station there' going to be an npr-style radio station playing stories from this future. 

For this radio station, I'm trying to have ecologists, climatologists, and other global earth science experts to come on and record themselves discussing the earth's future, showing how present damage will change the earth in 100 years, as well as what ways we can avoid a worse-than-expected climate disaster, or map out the steps between where we are now, and where we'll need to be to still be a part of this planet.

42,ecology,Which is worse: 3D printing or bitcoin?,"Hi. I am facing a decision on which I need some advice.

I am currently working in two jobs. One is a company that manufactures and sells 3D printers (the type that prints from plastic filaments). The other company makes money by running a bitcoin mining pool. I'm looking to only keep one of those jobs, as it would be somewhat more practical for me. I'm wondering which one of those two jobs is less unacceptable from ecological standpoint. Intuitively I'm leaning towards 3D printing being less bad, since bitcoin (esp. bitcoin mining) consumes ridiculous amounts of power, but it's kind of hard to say and there are multiple factors in play.

There's of course the third option of ditching both jobs and finding a more eco-friendly one. This might be an option but it's a longer-term goal and I need to make this decision rather soon.

If bitcoin and 3D printing are comparably bad, then I suppose I can just pick whichever is more convenient in other respects and keep looking for a 3rd job as I go.

While out fishing recently I realized the large amount of the Red Winged Black bird which I've never seen to much of up until recently. At first I thought maybe it was like the baader-meinhof phenomenon but I had later on gotten in conversations about other people noticing them either for the first time or a lot more. 

Subsequently  I've also seen very few Robins this year. From the amount I can recall I've seen around 2~3. Living in NJ my entire life I'm certain the population of Robins here is supposed to be very strong so this has me concerned.

Is the Black Bird pushing into Robin territory out competing and hurting its population? Are the population changes independent of each other however connected to rise in suburban housing? Or lastly, is my worry unfounded, perhaps the Robin has avoided my attention, and the black bird was always present in large amounts but I never cared to notice?

Just a question I was pondering today...


So when we talk about treatment of infections with antibiotics / antivirals, we stress the importance of completing the entire round so as to entirely wipe out the population and not allow any ‚ÄúSuperbugs‚Äù to survive the antibiotics and go on to proliferate into a resistant strain. 

However, it seems as though very similar mechanisms could exist in exogenous ecosystems as well. For instance, wouldn‚Äôt the use of pesticides also run the risk of producing ‚ÄúSuperbugs‚Äù (this time actual insects üòÇ, would they get a new name? )? It seems to me that because these fields are open systems, that almost certainly some insects would survive. But also, I wonder whether there is an ultimate desire to entirely eradicate pestilent species, just as we did with Smallpox? Or is that for some reason riskier?

In North Carolina, NC State has a graduate conservation program that does NOT require you to have a BS. You can come in from a different discipline and get caught up. I haven't seen anything like that elsewhere and as some of you might know, meticulously researching programs all over the country is quite overwhelming. I was wondering if any of you might have suggestions or similar situations to my own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

I have a BA in History and BA in French, and an M.A. in Public History (interpretation, oral history, etc.).  I'm interested in social history, community museums (my thesis was about indigenous village community museums in Latin America), and all. But especially interested ecology, ethnobotany, and environmental history. 

I've also taken environmental courses, continuing education dendrology classes, etc. A I am trying to get environmental education certification by taking ecology workshops in my homes tate of North Carolina, interned with an herbalist for three yeras, and worked on three farms in my life. 

Basically, what I'm getting at is that I have an MA in history but I've also always performed well in/loved science and history having to do with our relationship to the environment. 

Sometimes I wish I had majored in botany but hey, hindsight. I was 18 and wanted what I wanted then. All of my general ed classes I tried to make environmental related. 

In recent years I've thought about getting for real about conservation and ecology programs. I would LOVE to go back and get a BS but I'm also in my early 30's and feel pressure (from myself). I know the best thing to do would be to start fresh but I wonder if I could still found another way that didn't require getting a new bachelors AND more loans for it. 

I don't know. I'm a little lost and feel a little regretful of choices I've made and just trying to start the process of sorting out what I want to do in 2020.",1560976299

I've finished BSc Wildlife Ecology and Conservation and I'm wondering if anyone could give me an idea of the types of jobs available. My course, broad as it was, mainly discussed options in the area of outdoor ranger work or consultancy. I was set on going in to consultancy, but my lecturer actually put me off it a little bit when discussing the ""ethical implications"" of having so many graduates going in to the field. He also doesn't think consultants provide any real societal benefit. Another, more practical reason is that I currently don't drive and I'm not a fan of driving. You do a lot of driving in consultancy. It's one of those things where 3 years of talking about consultancy has made me think that's all I could really do, but I forget I have a decent understanding of theory as well as the use of  GIS and whatnot. Do you think it's possible to go into broader fields? I'm quite interested in doing something with biological records, something more ""in house"". Hell, I'd love to work in a museum, but I'm not sure what the route of entry is for that. I assume just having a degree in ecology isn't enough to work in collections? I'm just trying to keep my options open. I've spent the morning just trying to instil in myself that it's not all about consultancy.

The name 'Urban Wildlife' is already in use by a small one-man wildlife/pest management business, but most or all other names you can come up with will likely be fair game.

 \* **Rehab**, wildlife rehab. At first this will be primarily rescue &amp; transport. A rehab center will take a long time to grow into, it is resource heavy. I have some experience and a lot of contacts in this area, so even if this never sprouts, it's not a complete loss.

On a decadal scale. This is frightening. Bones are synonymous with infrastructure because we would literally collapse without them.

Our jaws are becoming so tiny that crooked teeth are a feature, not an aberration. Some believe our tiny mandibles changed our language, and allowed a 3-fold increase in the use of ""F"" and ""V"" sounds over time. This is why we can now easily say ""Fuck Vox!"".

Our smartphones are already changing the shape of our skulls and causing a spikey protuberance in the back near our necks. This is due to something called, ""text neck"". Our new slouching postures are straining the muscles attached to the base of our skulls ‚Äì and the body responds by laying down fresh layers of bone. This use to be rare ‚Äì not any more.

When we compare the height of a person to the width of a single elbow, we can see that human elbows are getting thinner. They are literally withering away.

Children do not play outside anymore ‚Äì they play video games and stare at toxic photon devices. These devices are damaging the brain's visual cortex and causing endemic myopia. They also cause physical and mental illness.

The chemicals, plastics and metals that make our devices contribute to the biological emasculation, feminization and sterilization of all male vertebrates. While I think our acceptance of biological sexual deviance is ultimately good, it does not bode well for the terrible future we face because we are mentally, physically and sexually weaker.

Problem is, with the work primarily being bat surveys, the shifts aren't very long. I do a lot of dawn surveys which are from 3.30am-5.30am.

So it's difficult to balance sleep, although I'm not actually working many hours. 

I'd like to have a flexible second job because I'm barely earning enough, but the nature of my job kind of eats up the day given the dawn work. I won't leave my job because it's a lucky entry into a career I want. But for now it's a bit of a catch-22.

Waste has to go in some kind of container to go in the chute.

I believe the kitchen bags for green waste can also be used for garbage and recycling, but I don't know whether they're no more biodegradable than grocery bags, or they degrade into different but equally bad substances. I also think paper bags are too fragile and risk messes.

In fact many people cut down trees for fire mitigation so I'm not sure if this one makes sense. The last thing I want to do is cause a forest fire. 

2. Try to organize a river/lake clean up barge like Baltimore Harbors [Mr. Trash Wheel](https://www.baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel/)

3. Keep bees. This one seems pretty popular but I'm not sure if it has any impact. I know there are lots of resources online about it. 

4. Volunteer with an existing conservation agency. 

5. Pick up trash. Pretty simple but not a big impact.

(As context, I have an MS in Ecology, but fairly limited on the job field experience, because my previous work was lab related)

Offer is for a temporary field tech, for the summer only (NEON project, if that matters). Pay is not great, and I'm concerned about it being short term. The project is interesting though, and it seems like there is a lot to learn here. This position is close enough to where I live, so I don't have to move. There is some hope of getting rehired afterwards at a different location, but no guarantee.

Alternatively, I've had an interview with a lab in Illinois. This is an academic position (which will not have much chance of extension), and since I am not interested in getting a PhD, this seems like a dead end. The work, however, involves wetlands which I think is good for my career if I want to consult or get a job for a larger company. They have not made an offer, but this looks promising. 

Lastly, I have an interview tomorrow with Fish and Wildlife Services in North Dakota. Obviously, not sure how well the interview will go, but the job is up to a year in duration, involves wetlands delineation and GIS work, which are skills that will be important for me to have in the future. Pay seems to be pretty good, considering the cost of living in ND is low. 

So my question is: is it worth holding out for either of these positions, or should I just take the job I am offered? Anything in between? How long do government organizations take to make a decision after an interview?

A large road development is taking place next to a nationally registered flying fox camp, which means that they have specific laws protecting them. Part of these laws states that you can't intentionally disturb the camp, so my company was engaged to do the monitoring for the project.

The flying fox monitoring is basically doing a whole lot of nothing except watching the bats and stopping works if they get disturbed and take flight. So yeah, the job is 10 straight hours of watching bats and occasionally talking through a radio...

So, in comes some dickhead. He asks the site manager what I'm doing and he tells him. So then this dude just starts going off. ""that cunt is doing fucking nothing except sitting on his ass. He's not doing fucking anything for this project except slowing us down. Who fucking cares if those bats fly off and die? All they fucking do is bite kids and kill them. Fuck that cunt. He's sitting there earning $160 an hour for doing nothing. Fuck him."" he went on for awhile.

I know he's full of shit and so ignorant. Like yeah I do slow things down but I'm here to reduce impacts to wildlife so we don't fuck up the environment. And yeah, I'm basically doing nothing but I'm still doing something important. And lol at the bats killing kids and me earning that amount of money (I bloody wish I was earning that much haha).

Here is the link: https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2019/05/13/the-last-post-even-if-it-kills-me/

This post will focus on PFAS and Phthalates, which is greek for this shit will fuck you up.

Introduction

Chemicals in air water food fabric pharma hygiene and container products are turning all male fish, frog, bird and mammal into females.

Petro Pharma Chemicals (PPCs) are also shrinking all male dicks.

PPCs will make 90% of North American and European men infertile by 2050.

Two types of PPCs are PFAS and PFOS, there are thousands of different PFAS/PFOS alone.

There are over one hundred thousand different PPCs, and they're everywhere.

PFAS/PFOS are called Forever Chemicals and will last longer than many rocks.

PFAS/PFOS show up in 99% of North America's blood.

Unlike vaccines, PFAS/PFOS affect us all.

PFAS/PFOS concentrate and accumulate up the food chain and towards the north.

They affect all vertebrate species and people in North America and Europe.

Now, I am not completely opposed to getting my master's, I truly love education and have interest in the field, so that makes things easier mentally and emotionally through this process. But financially, I don't know if my master's is the most viable option right now. And obviously I can wait to get it, if need be.

I guess I have two questions, with a somewhat misleading title: What is the real difference between being an ecologist vs. a wildlife manager? What interests me is ecosystem diversity and managing populations. I also have a tech background and would like to apply my GPS/GIS skills to this.

Secondly, are there any organizations, government or otherwise that will reimburse my tuition to get my masters?

Bonus question: I have been interested in getting my pilot's license for some time, just as a hobby or general interest. Could this be directly applicable to either field?

3,ecology,Struggling to find a job after graduation (rant),"I graduated in December 2018 and still haven't been able to find a job. I thought about going back for a masters or PhD but I absolutely hate school now because I feel it's a scam and testing is a bogus way of evaluating someone's skills.  Needless to say I did well in school, I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and took honor's classes and did extracurricular stuff, clubs, and internships. The issue I'm running into is that every job I apply to claims ""I don't have the minimum qualifications,"" when I know for a fact that I do because I generally don't apply to a position unless I know I can do it. I've applied to at least a thousand jobs in the past 5 months and have only had 5 interviews, 4 from the local government and 1 retail position (desperation).   


I have working experience in ecology as a research assistant and another as a horticulturist but I don't qualify for jobs in those fields apparently. I've had numerous people look over my resume and have done mock interviews and have improved dramatically on those but it is still to no avail.   
I've applied to government jobs both federally and on a state level, local and foreign. I've applied for private sector jobs and had no luck with those. I've asked for recommendations from professors and former colleagues, literally nothing works out. The only ""success"" I've had was getting a few interviews with the state government for wastewater management jobs. Never got a call back for those after the interview though. I was told that I was in the top 2 choices for a restoration job but they decided to give it to the guy that lived closer to them....and it was only a temp job.   
I've gotten desperate enough to start applying to jobs that I don't really want like teaching and medical services. I'm not opposed to either because they could provide experience but I haven't had any success with them, mainly because I don't have certifications, though some don't require it.   


Ironically the only job I had managed to get after college was working retail for minimum wage. The reason I decided to go to college and in-debt myself for tens of thousands of dollars was so that I could avoid the soul-crushing environment of retail. I am too much of an intellectual to be happy working in those types of jobs. It is not mentally stimulating enough and I quickly became overqualified and bored once the training period was over. I still work it because I need money though.   


It just really pisses me off that I worked my ass off in school and still end up getting shafted by this god awful job market. I was under the illusion that STEM degrees are worthwhile, and people who are good at mathematics and engineering can get jobs no problem. But the issue I face is that there are so many people applying for these jobs, people that already have decent jobs too (at least the ones I talked to) who have more experience, and are making it nearly impossible for recent grads to get their foot in the door.

Since I graduated, I've been doing the seasonal semi-paid fieldwork thing which I enjoy, but I haven't done any real analytical work and I'm beginning to get interested in exploring that a bit. I've been brushing up on QGIS and R while paying attention to the methods of papers I'm interested in and thinking about graduate school. My current job is tech work for medium to large carnivores but I'm not cleared to get access to the database we're contributing to. My position also only lasts a few months. 

Any insights as to how I could apply some stats on my own side project without a big data set to work on? 

This would ideally be something to improve my data analysis skills, bolster my resume, and show my old professors to get a good recommendation out of em. If it helps at all, I have some incipient interest in community ecology/wildlife biology/conservation biology, especially if it relates to rewilding. 

I recognize a project like this might not be necessary to get into a master's program, but I'd like to have as good a shot as I can get if I'm gonna go through with it, along with with a more mature idea of what research I'll want to participate in.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the quick version of what we found:  


1. Streams which are downstream of areas where more of the land is dedicated to human activity tend to have fewer unique species.
2. At a larger geographic scale, in our case a regional watershed, higher upstream land use was also associated with each local stream community becoming less similar to one another in terms of the species present.¬† This could be called an Anna Karenina principle: every community declines in its own unique way.
3. Using [zeta diversity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25325751), a more general framework for assessing changes in diversity across multiple communities, we were able to construct a well-correlated proxy for the [California Stream Condition Index](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioassessment/docs/csci_tech_memo.pdf), a measure of stream community health.

17,ecology,Where do things stand with the massive U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hiring initiative?," 

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago there was a huge federal hiring push by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. I'm sure many of us applied to at least one or two positions with them during this time period given the number of jobs that were available. I was fortunate enough myself to be referred to multiple hiring managers about four weeks ago, but haven't heard back from any of them yet to schedule interviews. What is frustrating is that it seems like USAJobs often will NOT update your application status to ""not selected"" if you get referred to a hiring manager but aren't chosen for an interview. This makes it impossible to make an informed decision about whether to accept other jobs, because it's not clear whether the hiring managers haven't selected you or just haven't gotten around to following up about interviews yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I was wondering if anyone knew about the status of these positions? Have most hiring managers already contacted people they want to interview? Or, if you also applied to these positions and were referred, have you heard back from any hiring managers yourself about interviews?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm speaking specifically about the Wildlife Biologist and Fish &amp; Wildlife Biologist positions that were posted as part of the massive USFWS hiring initiative back in February, but would also welcome comments on any other USFWS jobs, as this might help out other people who are in a similarly confusing position. I really wish USAJobs was better about updating the application status of people who get referred but not selected for an interview, but I'm hoping that by mutually sharing our experiences, we can maybe make each other less confused?

&amp;#x200B;

If it's helpful for others: I applied to both the ""public"" and ""recent grads"" versions of the Wildlife Biologist and Fish &amp; Wildlife Biologists positions, for every location they were offered (except AK/HI), at both GS-5 and GS-7 levels. I got referred to 40+ hiring managers roughly four weeks ago, but haven't heard back since.",1557171762

There are 3 types of goals each organization has for their land based on their rights to it.

Financial/Environmental/Social Goals

What goals would each of these organization be focusing on based on their rights over the land?
After giving it some thought, 

I would guess that a small woodlot owner is interested in social or financial gain.

The community is focused on environmental and social goals.

The timber company is focused on financial goals, but also has to focus on environmental goals to achieve sustainable tree cutting.

And the US Forest service is focused on financial and Environmental goals.

53,ecology,Undergraduate assistant positions to study evolutionary impacts of tropical cyclones,"  

**Project Description**: In collaboration with investigators across the world, we will explore the short- and long-term evolutionary impacts of tropical cyclones around the globe. This will include monitoring the physical damage caused by tropical cyclones, documenting their evolutionary impacts on animal behavior, and characterizing the selection pressures that underly cyclone-induced evolutionary change. We will further experimentally subject groups of animals to cyclonic conditions to evaluate phenotypic plasticity in behavior and physiology during the cyclones themselves. Undergraduate assistants will participate in all aspects of the study and are very likely to receive coauthorship on one or more papers for their contributions. Undergraduates are further encouraged to develop their own sub-project ideas within this study‚Äôs larger logistical framework.

**Duration**: two field seasons are available June-September 2019 (southeast USA), January-April 2020 (northern Australia)

**Requirements**: Applicants should have a strong academic track record with an interest in graduate training in behavioral science, ecology, evolutionary biology, geographic, data science, or climate science. Participants must be capable of performing prolonged fieldwork in hot and humid conditions and be capable of lifting 50 lbs repetitively. Applicants are required to have a driver‚Äôs license and a clean driving record. A positive and outgoing disposition are genuinely imperative. Applicants with experience in entomology and insect identification, GIS, or professional scientific photography are especially encouraged to apply.

**Pay**: Participants‚Äô travel expenses, food, and lodging will be covered for the duration of the project. They will further receive a stipend of 1500 USD/month 

**Application Materials:** Interested applicants should send a 1-page cover letter detailing their match for the position, preferred field season (June-Sep, Jan-April, or both), GPA/major/program, GRE scores (if available), relevant training/experience, and long-term career goals. Please also provide two academic references that can speak to your ability to operate under field conditions. Application materials should be e-mailed to [PruittLabSearch2019@gmail.com](mailto:PruittLabSearch2019@gmail.com).

Oftentimes, forest acreage is cut down in order to farm this implant grass. In many cases, HOAs require home owners to greatly alter the natural state of their properties. I wonder if there have been any action committees to promote a bill that gives homeowners the legal right to natural-scape their lawns even when it may conflict with neighborhood regulations, perhaps a certification that says ""This lawn isn't neglected, it's a natural sanctuary.""

For me this meant that I had to turn up to the site office as the big boss/supervisor got there on the second day to tell him what was happening and that they couldn't do this and that. He ummed and ahhed for a bit and finally let me back on site. Whilst this was happening, my boss was reporting the siting to the roads people and environment department. Roads people said that they had to immediately stop all works in the relevant habitat areas until they submitted a new environmental agreement which would require approval before commencing.

So, what happened was the 24 year old fauna guy came in and stopped all works along 120km of highway because they didn't submit an adequate environmental agreement and were caught out because I found this snake. 

This caused a lot of pain for a lot of contractors who wanted to get their job done. They then expressed all their outrage about the situation and the ""dumb cunt"" (ie me) that caused the problem, over the UHF channel. I had my radio on me, so I could hear it all. I picked it up and just said ""fauna spotter here"" thinking they were would realise that they were being dicks. But no, they continued to hurl abuse indirectly (and a bit directly) at me, referring to me as ""the guy that wants to sing kumbaya with the trees and whales"".

So yeah, I did the right thing and tried to get them to correct their practices so they didn't kill individuals of this endangered snake, but more importantly that they complied with the law. The fellow contractors got very upset about it. I didn't do anything wrong or overly ""green"". I just did what I'm supposed to do under the law, and I did the right thing morally imo.

So yeah, how can I not let their comments get to me?",1554969594

My main love is evolution, but more on a macro-scale, community interactions, reading about classical evolutionary biologists like W.D Hamilton and E.O Wilson who modeled interactions, and I want to study postgrad but if I take the ecological options at uni which is like making collections, counts etc. Will this reflect poorly on me if I wish to pursue evo/eco postgrad?

35,ecology,How can a net CO2 emitter's national ecological footprint be within its biocapacity?,"According to the Global Footprint Network, [Finland's ecological footprint](https://data.footprintnetwork.org/#/countryTrends?cn=67&amp;type=BCpc,EFCpc) (which includes the need for carbon sequestration) is less than half of its biocapacity. Yet Finland's carbon sinks capture only 46% of its greenhouse gas emissions.

As a curious layperson, I spent hours googling and reading papers but couldn't find a way to reconcile this seeming contradiction.

Here are some potential explanations I considered:

1. My first thought was that perhaps biocapacity should be thought of as _potential_ for carbon sequestration, whether that potential is realized as carbon sinks or not. I rejected this explanation because I find it impossible to believe that Finland could quadruple its carbon sinks while doubling other forms of land use, which is what this definition of biocapacity would suggest.

2. The ecological footprint only includes CO2 emissions, so my second thought was that maybe other greenhouse gases could explain the difference between the ecological footprint and actual GHG emissions. This didn't work out either, as Finland's GHG emissions are 81% CO2.

3. Next, I considered if exports could shift Finland's emissions to some other countries' footprints. I focused on the energy sector, as it produces 74% of Finland's emissions, but Finland turned out to be a clear net importer of energy, so if anything, trade should increase its ecological footprint.

4. I'm completely unqualified to evaluate the science behind the ecological footprint calculation, but for the sake of completeness I also considered the option that maybe the ecological footprint is such a weak proxy indicator for CO2 emissions and sinks that it can grossly underestimate the former and exaggerate the latter.

I'd be grateful if this community could be help me understand how the ratio of ecological footprint to biocapacity should be understood in the context of climate change and especially how to reconcile a country's biocapacity reserve with its unsequestered GHG emissions.

Our mental ecosystem is at odds with the survival of all the non-subterranean bacteria on earth. 

Physics says all the trees act as a space/earth solar battery. Trees are the batteries that save us from the vacuum of space. We are searching for the perfect battery and trees are it.

We created a mental ecosystem of electrons and minerals.

This ecosystem preys on ignorance and rewards luck and knowledge.

This ecosystem makes nerds billionaires.

Right now China has a robotic robot manufacturing plant.

China is buying up American chip and bio-tech companies because chips are China's #2 import.

China uses petrochemicals to turn those minerals into phones.

Petrochemical use is growing 7X faster than human population.

China has more highway than any country on earth.

China has 60% more high speed trains than all other countries.

China has the largest car market on earth.

China is a leader in methane clathrate and nuclear power.

China's Huawei phone will put Apple out of the hardware market.

China just built the world's largest underground tunnel to Tibet.

India's energy emissions growth is through the roof.

Euro/American men are becoming feminized and sterilized through years of petrochemical and pharma exposure.

Like my momma always said never mix your drinks.

We have micro-plastics lodged in our brains. We eat food that kills bugs, birds, bees, flowers and trees.

We are strip mining soil to grow poisoned food for personal wealth.

To prevent wealth from destroying earth, we have to tax it and pay it back in a universal basic income.

But we're too busy trying to be rich.

Scientists, politicians, preachers all chasing the dollar.

We see Yemen aid funding appeals while we let them starve.

China is a world leader in 5G.

The idea that China and Germany are environmental leaders is a lie.

Germany owns Bayer and Monsanto, both pharma and petrochemical.

Germany burns imported clear cut forests for 50% of its green energy and burns palm oil in their diesel fuel.

China is building 400 nuclear plants and 700 coal plants.

Most of the men in Asia/Africa are very young and have not been exposed to petro- pharma- chemicals long enough to feminized and sterilized.

After 30 years solar panels and wind turbines are 2% of total world energy demand, during which time emissions went up 60%.

Emissions must go down 100% in 20 years to avoid runaway hothouse extinction.

We can't have a 5G surveillance target war economy and a planet.

We have to tax world wealth with 100% private carbon taxes or the rich will destroy the planet flying to climate conferences.

Wealth + China ‚â† Earth

It was a total of 10 nights and on the 9th, I just hit a brick wall and had a bit of a cry for about 15mins. I was absolutely mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted at that point. I'll give you some context. 

We were doing a survey on freshwater turtles, and were snorkeling in mountain streams to catch them. 

A typical day would involve at least 4 hours of snorkeling plus the walking back down the river whilst carrying a weight belt and a bag of turtles. The maximum air temps were much lower than expected, around 18c/64f, so the mountain creeks/rivers were hella cold and we only had 3mm wetsuits. When I woke up one morning it was 7c/44f and we had to go snorkeling. 

Walking down the creeks was murder because I broke my aquatic shoes so was walking on rocks for kilometres and was getting so many cuts and scrapes.

The snorkeling itself was so scary and dangerous because it was in murky water full of snags, rocks, and weeds. And not to mention the 1.5m/5ft eels that popped out of nowhere and scared the shit out of me. Plus the pressure of actually catching turtles. 

There were these underwater mites/something that got inside your wetsuit and gave you these painful and extremely itchy bites.

And another thing that got to me was the isolation. There was just me and my new boss that I've only known for 2 weeks, and I had no way to contact anyone else. 

And lastly, we had to dismantle and erect camp every day, mostly in the rain.

So yeah. This trip was fucking hard because of the conditions and I just had a bit of a breakdown one night (I think it was just exhaustion).

I kind of feel like maybe I'm not cut out to do this kind of work, but I did absolutely love it. It was mainly the rain, cold, and dangerous conditions that got to me.

I've discovered that when water becomes anoxic, only organisms that can survive in anoxic waters will live there. Which will cause high levels in Sulfate in water. This is harmful for health.

67,ecology,"Ecology of Human Personality - Partnerships, Predation, and more - A Practical Theoretical Approach","**The Model**

Personality: a consistent set of traits like a stoic, rational father figure. (Variable personalities below)

Peer Attraction (+/+): who this personality attracts as peers (like)

Partner Attraction (+/+): who this personality attracts as collaborators (opposites)

Dependents (+/+): who becomes a dependent symbiote

Dependent On (+/+): who this person is dependent on as a symbiote

The Don't Cares (+/0): who does not care about this person

Predators / Parasites (+/-): who hunts and eats this personality, or lives off of it. 

Prey (+/-): who this personality eats or lives off of

Competitor Attraction (+/-): who this personality attracts as competitors

**Personality 1: Stoic, Rational Father Figure (e.g. Liam Neeson)**

Let's use Liam Neeson in the movie Taken as a fun example. I haven't seen the movie in at least 5 years, so just imagine the character and let me improvise.

Personality: stoic, rational father figure. 

Peer Attraction: likely to hang out with other stoic, rational father figures like himself (grab a beer, discuss problems, go shooting or hunting)

Partner attraction: likely to attract an expressive, emotional mother figure (opposite) with similar goals (raise family)

Dependents: children, wife, anyone else under protection

Dependent on: the ideal imagination model for this personality is nobody, though in reality it's many (pilot of the plane who takes him overseas, manufacturer of his ammunition, etc.)

Don't cares: monks, celibates, most animals, expressive and emotional men

Predators / Parasites: salespeople who challenge this person's manliness or brand weak or a coward in order to lure into a trap. Unnecessary dependents, ranging from the homeless and poor who want a shelter to the cute kitten the father's child wants to keep. More likely to be killed by competition than true predator.

Prey: in rural solitude, literal prey like hunting deer. In urban environments, the weak in order to use their energy, labors, and money for his benefit.

Competitors: other stoic, rational males who want to occupy the same niche. 

**Personality 2: passive awakened monk**

Peer attraction: others at same level of spiritual attainment

Partner attraction: assertive, unawakened socialite? Not sure. Seems about right. 

Dependents: lost souls in anguish

Dependent on: whomever brings this person food or money

Don't cares: most people

Predators / Parasites: aggressive conquerors, but only if they could enslave physically (or through a bodily need like food)

Prey: this person can easily prey on dependents, lost souls. Could also gaslight segments of society, especially if harbored by aggressive conquerors in order to gaslight other aggressive conquerors' organizations. Likely to prey on anyone needed to meet needs.

Competitors: other awakened monks going after same dependents or prey.

**Branding/Reputation**

All of these relationship dynamics self-reinforce and get stronger the more well known one is and the stronger this person's brand is. 

**Multiple Personality Types**

What if a person can wear many hats? This is likely to result in inconsistent reputation / brand. The person will be different things to different people, resulting in increased versatility at the expense of fewer and less effective differentiation.

For example, many military people are great at war but awful at nearly everything else. A working mom is likely to be decent at her job and have decent abilities to mom. A restaurant entrepreneur is likely to be a decent waiter, busser, host, bartender, salesperson, and accountant from experience, but overall not the best at any of them. 

**Analysis and Implications**

I for one expect that people naturally adapt to the niches available to them to the extent that it is beneficial for them to do so. So, I don't think anything actually needs to be done by anyone other than what they are naturally going to do.

Human competition and predation isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It's built into our social system.

If you create a strong brand in anything valuable, you will have competition. Also, because you have a consistent personality and brand, you will be consistently vulnerable to predators who are well-versed in exploiting your type of personality. 

Last, this is why you should never try to change people. Everyone self-selects their personality based on their gifts in life as well as their opportunities. As you can see, their life and relational system is based on this personality. If you attempted to change this person's personality, they would likely fight you because you are jeopardizing their entire life. If you succeeded, you would actually ruin their entire life in exchange for this one relationship with you. One example of this is slavery, which benefits the slaveowner but is horrifying for the slave. Another example is an unhealthy marital relationship, where a person cuts off their spouse from other friendships and relationships in order to shape the person into their ideal spouse.",1553997332

I decided to go to college and am currently in my freshman year trying flesh out some sort of path for myself. I'm very interested in plants and plant science, and I have narrowed it down to a few options. There are 3 options that I think fit what I want to do, or are at least close and they are Environmental Biology w/ a focus in Plants, Chemistry w/ a focus in BioChemistry, and Geology. I'd be happy working in a lab with plants, out in the field, and/or in greenhouse/nurseries. I am also open to odd plant jobs I may not be aware of currently. From the research I've done, it seems that most scientific disciplines will require grad school, which I am ok with, if need be. I checked the National Bureau Of Labor Statistics and found that in my state, North Carolina, Plant and Soil Scientists are paid pretty decently(low cost of living here) with the mean salary of about 74k  per year.  https://www.bls.gov/oes/2017/may/oes191013.htm#ind  Do you guys and gals think this checks out?

China will become the dominant user of petrochemicals.

I don't believe PFAS, pesticide, herbicide and pharmacide regulation is high on their list of priorities. Only by taxing the rich we can prevent psychotic behavior.

Do you know that 3.5 billion people fly each year? That's half the people on earth. Corporations NGOs and governments have been fighting climate change for 30 years, and emissions went up 60% in 30 years. Socialism and capitalism have been at odds for 100 years. It will take 50 years for socialism to spread worldwide if we don't shut down tax havens for the rich. You can't put the cart before the horse.

Male Feminization Affects All Vertebrates: 
---

This next link is important because species feminization has been found in even remote wilderness areas. There's also a link about how pesticides can make humans depressed and males infertile.

This all happened because academia sold out to big business 100 years ago. Be sure to check out the Academic Fraud section. You heard of fake news, will wait til you hear about fake science.

https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/29/unfinished-business/

**The Revengey Part**

The recycling program is revealed for the fraud it is. All our plastic is spreading throughout the food chain. I've even heard said there's micro-plastics lodged in our brains. 

Most Euro/American men will be sterile by 2050. Euro/Americans are more feminized than Africa and Asia. We are dulled depressed and sickened by our own air water and food.

There are maybe a billion Euro/Americans, so maybe 5 billion African/Asians. They are more young virile and male due to limited multiple exposures so far. China is building massive infrastructure to serve these markets, and those young billions will not be socialist during the boom phase. 

We can't flood the world with sex robots and drones. We are not going to live on Mars and big fast EVs won't change anything. After 30 years of trying, solar and wind are only 1-3% of the world's total energy use. 

We have to destroy demand within 10 years. When people say we got 10 years to fix the climate, it doesn't mean we got until the last day of the 9th year. 

It is not only PFAS feminizing species, it's the combination of petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and wifi in the air water food.

Every toy drone is made of plastic and trace metals. Every fitbit is killing the earth. Urban classrooms can be 1,000 ppm CO2 and filled with off gassing PFAS that are also found in drinking water. Herbicides rot your gut and pesticides make males infertile and mentally ill. Dow gave us this with their non-stick, stain-free, fire-proof, waterproof clothes and furniture because cigarettes kept burning down houses back in the day when everyone smoked.

Video time turns kids myopic, rewires their brain and causes them to become addicted to ideological fantasies. The pollution in urban air is like smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, and makes us stupider. Urban classroom air at 1,000 ppm CO2 makes kids 15% stupider. Kids drink juice and water are filled with toxic metals, which make them stupider. Imagine how smart our kids would be without all this. Of course if affect poor blacks more than rich whites, but that's not what matters anymore, because its spreading to the rest of the world, and they're all the same race.

Wifi is a brand new experiment the human race can't give up. The 5G rollout will be like sticking our testicles and heads in a microwave. 

5G IOT AI WIFI is why China is buying up oil, instead of burning oil in cars, we can now turn oil into ipads and phones. Petrochemical demand is growing 7X faster than population growth. 

By assigning fake safe limits to everything we've ignored how much of everything there is everywhere, and their cumulative power over our evolutionary destiny. We can't escape our race sex class or even geography, but we can tax the rich without the government. Here's how...

I am a delusional optimist because I believe 100% private carbon taxes on the rich can fix avarice. By taxing the rich we can sublimate deep state surveillance/targeting AI into a universal basic income worldwide. Taxing the rich with 100% private carbon taxes means 100% of it goes back to the poor, no middle man. 

We have the computing power to keep track of every dollar on earth. This means we can eliminate tax havens, if we transition from oil security dollars to a world basic income. World socialism will take decades, we can tax greed in just a few years.

I am not educated, so if you are, then spread this topic, but don't expect any success, but lots of blowback. I know because denial is something I'm good at.

Thiamine deficiency is affecting life at the top of the seafood chain including seabirds etc., and scientists don't know which pollutants are the cause, which also means there are other likely causes. 

Researchers also flagged increasing evidence of thiamine deficiencies in a range of taxonomic groups and in ocean waters as a possible driver of wildlife declines. This is especially worrisome how it affects plankton. We can't figure out if its pollutants or climate change or both.

To those who know the field far better than I do, how often can I expect to dive in a Marine Ecology position? Primarily based in the UK, though I intend to move to New Zealand in the next 10 years.

I am a sensitive person and I try to stay optimistic about the future of the planet, but according to all available scientific evidence we are going to have multiple massive die-offs of species within my lifetime - hell, before I'm even old enough to retire. The time for incremental change passed decades ago, and nothing short of radical changes on the part of humans is going to lessen the impact of impending environmental devastation.

But people aren't willing to make those changes. The future of life as we know it depends on the accountability and action of the majority of humans, and frankly, the majority of humans just don't care enough to do anything meaningful. A small minority of very committed, impassioned people is realistically not enough to have any impact in the amount of time we have to actually affect change. So what is the point?

&amp;#x200B;

From my current knowledge, the flowers of the undergrowth layer/forest floor are only restricted to pollination by animals as they cant release their pollen through the wind. Hence, they are left with the only option of attracting animals to pollinate the flowers for them which explains why there are so many colourful and fragrant flowers (E.g. orchids and heliconia) in this layer. There is convergent evolution occurring as many species all converge into the same method of pollination. This method of pollination is effective considering the abundance of insects in this layer..

&amp;#x200B;

Is all this true?\^\^

&amp;#x200B;

From my current knowledge, cross-pollination is also highly favoured in the rainforest due to the high diversity of pathogens and fungi that might breach into plant systems.

I was doing seasonal work while looking for something permanent afterwards, but the only thing I could get was a position with an environmental consulting firm. (I had a lot of interviews, but there was always a skill another candidate had more of.) No shade to anyone who does consulting, but this particular firm has zero interest in or opportunity for helping the environment beyond the minimum legal requirements and does no research, which defeats the major points of why I entered the field.

I have been here 9 months (while still applying for jobs and getting a few interviews, but I've hardly seen any non-consulting positions I might qualify for) and I'm really concerned that being in consulting will keep me from being considered for the kind of position I want (which is something management, conservation, and/or research based, for a general idea think wildlife biologist with FWS). I don't want to go back to seasonal work due to financial/health insurance stuff- and I already did seasonal work all through undergrad and for 4 years after! 

Was anyone else in this situation? Or does someone have insight into how employers for the kind of position I want see consulting? Consulting won't really give me any of the skills I was told I was lacking in, but I guess I want to know how related it is considered to be to the wildlife/ wildlife management field.

2)The effect of depth on total zooplankton abundance. Again, here I was planning on doing a mixed effects model again for my different depth categories, and then having the random effect of date

3) The effect of time on total zooplankton abundance. I was planningon just doing a repeated measures anova for this one.

Carnivorous plants became carnivorous because of the lack of nutrients in the soils they grow in. However, this contracts my aforementioned points as the soils in tropical rainforests are supposedly nutrient-rich?

2 posts:

&gt;When diving, one of the first rules you are taught is to not touch marine life unless absolutely necessary, often out of respect and conservation for the animal. It's incredibly hypocritical for such prominent divers and dive operators to turn around and start portraying unnecessary amounts of contact in the name of conservation....Ocean is a repeat offender.  It also paints actual marine scientists in a bad light by normalising frequent animal contact as ""research""...Don't touch the marine life. It's simple.

&gt;I know she does, which is why I so strongly object to her actions. Marine biologists that I know personally take issue with them; touching marine life and riding on them is not OK. You don't see Paul Nicklen doing that, and he's done way more to raise awareness.

It's clear that with highly endangered animals like the Hawaiian monk seal (less than 1,500 left), you want strict *no-touch* rules. And Hawaii banned people bothering resting dolphins.

Bear with me - it's sort of a two part question and admittedly vague.

I'm well into a moderately successful tech career (Electrical Eng + CompSci), but I'm dissatisfied with tech and would like to do something more meaningful and lasting, and am considering something in the ecology arena. I find myself spending most of my free time in learning about ecology (occasional biology/ecology college classes; lots of reading) or other outdoor pursuits (hiking and nature photography in particular).  I feel strongly about directly helping our environment.

I've done some googling and basic research on the field, but I'm not really sure if I'm finding good (or up to date) resources. I think I lean towards wildlife ecology, and/or habitat restoration.

Where can I learn more about these fields? Or other options I should consider? 

Also, I'm assuming a 4 year degree is a minimum requirement - but are there ways into the field without a degree? Not that I'm against education (I've got a solid 160 university credit hours under my belt). I'm just curious what non-traditional paths into the field might exist?",1547491131

28,ecology,Biological Technician vs. Conservation Corps,"Hi! I could use some advice from anyone. For context, I have a BS in ecology and aspire to be a biologist eventually. Here it goes:

I was offered a position on a conservation corps that would mostly be doing rangeland and wildland restoration work like spraying weeds with herbicides. I'm excited to live in that particular location, but I'm concerned with the work and pay. The pay is super low. I could live on it, but I'm not stoked on low pay for hard work. The work might be ok. Spraying herbicide on weeds all day, every day sounds boring, but maybe I could be involved with GPS tracking where the weeds are or start to shape my career in the direction of invasive species. And this position starts relatively soon, which is favorable. 

Another factor is the schedule. I'd have 8 or 9 day hitches with 5 or 6 days off. During a hitch, I'll have to camp in the woods, which effectively turns a 10 hour day into a 24 hour day, in my opinion. I like to do my own thing after work. 

 And I really like the town that this position is based out of. Maybe I could use this position to gain connections in the community, and then stay in this town with a better job after my time with the conservation corps is up.

So, I could take that position, or I could wait and find a biological technician position. I'm trying to decide if this is a smarter career move. But, most bio technician position start in MAY, and right now it is DECEMBER. I'd have to spend some time on unemployment or take a service industry job short term. Oh, and this technician job could be anywhere, from a small town in the Eastern Sierra where I have no friends to a small town in Colorado where I do have friends. And they end in October.  

I'm frustrated that at the technician level I can't find winter work. I don't know if I should consider taking a sub-par job with a sub-par salary just to live/make connections in a place I can see myself living long term. Or if I should keep searching for that elusive long term biological technician position in a place I see myself living. Advice, anyone?",1545448157

31,ecology,masters student - curious about taxonomy?,"Hi all,

So, I've always been drawn to invertebrate zoology and I know that I'd like my thesis (and most likely my future career) to be in that field. However, I swear every year I change my mind regarding exactly which direction I'll go. From water quality monitoring, insects as vectors of diseases, to conservation, everything I've had experience with has been super enticing. I guess I still don't know entirely what I'd like to do career wise, and I like the idea of having broad skills and experiences.

Anyways, I'm currently a masters student, and we are required to do a \~10week research project before we tackle our thesis. I've stumbled upon an opportunity to join a working group and do at least one species description as a part of a much larger project regarding endemic aquatic invertebrates. I think it sounds super interesting! I've always been interested in taxonomy, but I don't have any experience with it. The guy in charge of the project told me that this would be a great chance for me to see if taxonomy is for me and if it is, he's very sure that I'd be able to end up working with him for my thesis. However, it seems that if you choose the taxonomy route, you're forever a taxonomist as I'm personally not familiar with any ecologist/taxonomists. 

Does anyone have any input on this? Is it possible to do really do both? I guess I worry about specializing too much in a certain field as I don't want to limit myself. 

PS it's late and I'm exhausted, and hope I'm making sense haha. Just looking for a little bit of input :)",1545343236

65,ecology,"Please, ask me questions! I need to know if ENV SCI is right for me as a prospective grad student (and ultimately, career-wise).","Evergreen College in Olympia, WA has a Masters of Environmental Studies program. Deadline to apply is approx one month from now. I've thought about it, over and over, and seek some input from others if it's right for me (I have posted here before). Some things I like about the program: it's largely interdiscplinary, giving you several different angles on how these environmental issues are interconnected. It also allows for a good amount of independent work, where studies can work with faculty to answer their own Q's. It's relatively cheap and flexible.

I graduated with a B.A. in East Asian Studies (Japanese semi-fluency) 7 years ago; my background in science is minimal. Over the last 1.5 years I've done a little avian ecology work, volunteered for the Audubon, zoo, etc. Nothing super immersive other than the 1-month internship in Ecuador for avian ecology.

Here's what I know: a lot of my interest in this field revolves around Animal Behavior. I also think birds are pretty fascinating (certainly some overlap here). I also consider myself a realist -- Global Warming + declining animal species counts really alarm me, and I find it likely that I would get a lot more fulfillment in working towards these real issues than something like sports analytics (last 3 years), which in fact, doesn't matter outside of the tiny world that it operates within. I know that I'm good at asking the right questions, have a pretty good ear/eye in the field, and would also be interested in doing some collaborative work between US-JPN as it might involve a bi-lingual component. 

Here's what I also know, leading to some dissonance: I've never been naturally keen on hiking or camping, esp. alone. Nature walks never intrigued me until I started taking an interest in birds. Science courses never grabbed me growing up, and I spent most of my years in school coasting, incl. college (I did earnestly learn when studying abroad). I think it's important for me, in general, to have a decent amount of balance, so spending all my time in the field doing point counts or all my time with an excel sheet in an office would both get to me. I may want to limit my collegiate and professional experiences to WA state, at least as much as possible. I'm also not sure that focusing on *just* avian conservation would sit right with me, as there are so many other organisms in dire need of assistance right now.

Any questions like: ""are you willing to ____? Do you enjoy ___? What are you hoping for with ____?"" may ultimately help in my decision.

(Im a HS senior who loves the idea of working with fish, but I‚Äôm scared of the amount of jobs, the pay, etc etc)","Long story short, I‚Äôm a senior in high school and fish have always been really interesting to me. When I say I like fish, I REALLY like fish. I‚Äôve even written a lot of my college admission essays about them. I‚Äôd love to study fish in college (probably major in fisheries and aquatic sciences, but a different major wouldn‚Äôt bother me either. Whatever would work the best). It doesn‚Äôt matter what job I have with fish, as long as it isn‚Äôt a back breaking hard labor job. I‚Äôm open to a lot of different things. The reason I am leaving my options so wide open is because I‚Äôve always been told that there are not a lot of jobs in fish/fisheries, and the jobs that are out there are far from where I live (the Midwest). I don‚Äôt want to come out of college with a great education on fish/fisheries and not be able to get a job. So, I‚Äôm just trying to keep my options as wide open as possible in the hopes that there is some career out there involving fish that will mitigate these problems. I‚Äôve always heard the pay is low as well. The pay doesn‚Äôt bother me as long as I‚Äôd be able to support a family off of it, and as long as we wouldn‚Äôt be struggling. I don‚Äôt need to be rich. I just really wouldn‚Äôt like to live paycheck to paycheck. 

Honestly, I threw the whole idea of ever working with fish out of my mind for a while now because of the problems I‚Äôve heard regarding it. Lately, I‚Äôve  been seeing it as a dream job that will probably never happen to do logistical problems. So, I‚Äôve shifted my focus to environmental engineering instead, which does interest me, but not nearly as much as fish do.

Basically, what I‚Äôm asking is this: What are my options when it comes to fish related careers? How are the jobs in fisheries? Are there any fish nutritionist jobs? What about jobs which study fish? Jobs which raise ornamental aquarium fish? I‚Äôm open to any input, and any job suggestions you may have. I really just don‚Äôt want to give up on the dream prematurely. It‚Äôs okay if the dream has to die, I just want to make sure that it dies for a good reason not because I didn‚Äôt do enough research.

Biologist usually define it as a study of living organisms in relation to their environment. It is also known as environment biology. Ecology is a practical science. It involves


‚Ä¢ measuring factors affecting the environment;


‚Ä¢ studying the distribution of living organisms; and¬†


‚Ä¢ finding out how living organisms depend on on one another and their non living environment for their survival.


¬† ¬†As living organisms, we are also part of the environment, interacting with other living organisms and the non living environment. As organisms who make the greatest impact on the environment, we need to study ecology. This will help us to understand how we affect our environment, and so enable us to utilize its resources wisely.


We are going to discuss the organization levels in ecology to give us an understanding of the basic ecological concepts needed for carrying out particular ecological studies.

I'm the science lab coordinator at a small urban university in a major US city. I am looking for a hands-on laboratory experiment that my non-science-major, introductory biology students could do to learn about ecology. It can be about any aspect of ecology, but this unfortunately has to be an indoors, on-site lab because one of my labs runs until 10 pm, there is no money/method for fieldtrip transportation, and this is not an area where you want to wander around in parks at night. 

In addition, it needs to be an experiment that students could feasibly write a short lab report on, and I would prefer not to involve food (like a candy/tragedy of the commons activity) so as to not violate lab protocols. I am also trying to avoid just handing my students data from elsewhere and making this a data analysis lab (e.g. urban temps vs. forest temps using USGS temperature data).

I have a background in ecology/wildlife biology, and many of the good experiments I can think of or found online are field-based. I would love to do the classic graveyard population curve activity, but that is not feasible here. 

Any ideas for ecology labs I could do with my students? I appreciate any thoughts you have to offer!",1542033600

First of, let me start by saying that I'm no more than an enthusiast when it comes to habitat network and conserving connectivity, please excuse me for any misused term. Also I'm not a native english speaker, expect grammar and spelling mistakes.

Other than that, pretty much everything is in the title. I'm reading about designing network for biodiversity that satisfies both the needs of specifics species but also the uncertainties in future land-use and climate change. I'm only at the beginning so if you have any recommendation for me to read I'll gladly take them.

But the main thing I'm looking for now are studies taking place after the restoration of a habitat network that asses the effectiveness of the measures. I see a lot of modelisation but no real results of a post restored network.

I am an undergrad student, planning to do my masters and then my PhD in Ecology. 

Years ago, I read that Google/Amazon/etc. do their design work, planning and product development in work groups consisting of experts from various fields - graphic designers, engineers, programmers, mathematicians, artists and so on. I was wondering whether or not we, as ecologists, could include this approach to design better/more interesting experiments for future scientific work. Can't there be interesting new ideas a graphic designer thinks of, being presented with a problem from ecology (adequately broken down so that we speak a common language)? 

I think professionals with different backgrounds have different approaches to find solutions, and I feel like the best ecological experiements are the simplest - so why not combine and try?

I've seen the reports for the past months and they are all the same and kind of simple. In the past reports, there are just data upon what species there are: (ornithological, hematological, etc) some charts about the weather conditions and some charts with the species diversity. I always have the same species in my report but I need to do something different from the guy that occupied my job before me.

From my preliminary research I have found that it is quite a difficult field to have a stable career out of. I have also found that a lot of people have trouble finding ""success"" (depending on your definition of success). The only reason I ask is because I have been rethinking big life stuff and things, and kinda realized that the one common interest/passion that I have had in my life, is ""nature"" and ecology. But I did not go into that field when I began college, because I was worried about what I would do after. While going to school this year I kind of realized that, that just isn't right. I shouldn't forgo a passion out of fear for the future. I have decided That I don't want to pursue something that I will keep me financially stable (stupid right) but rather something I am truly passionate about. If you guise could give me some advice as to where I go from here or what things I should do to prepare for the long journey ahead. Or maybe provide some insight to your life and how you got to where you are today.

15,ecology,Is ecology for me?,"A little about myself. A horribly long time ago I studied ecology as an undergraduate. I found the subject material interesting and I enjoyed the occasional field work that was on offer. I especially enjoyed a class on freshwater ecology, so I decided to make that the subject of my MSc. In retrospect (and as a warning to anyone else in a similar situation) I should have first spent time volunteering with, or working for, an organisation to determine if it really was for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward two years, and while I enjoyed my MSc, it was more class and lab based than I would have liked. I enjoyed it enough, however, that after my MSc I decided to work for the government as a freshwater scientist; I did so for close to two years. I didn't mind the work, but it wasn't challenging and the environment wasn't great. There were also no signs of progression (people would often joke that jobs would only became available when someone higher up died), at least not without additional education. And so I applied for a PhD ...

&amp;#x200B;

A number of things, largely out of our control, went wrong in the field, so the project had to be changed drastically. Fast forward again, and I'm proud with what I've achieved given everything, but I'm also jaded; the field is extremely biased toward a handful of species, and the main impetus for research, at least in my field, was to make anglers happy. I'm being flippant, but there's some truth to that. I felt unvalidated and that my work was unimportant. 

&amp;#x200B;

And so here I am, unsure about what to do next. While I like the complexity of freshwater ecosystems and the challenges that provides, there's nothing unique to it that I enjoy or that I'm passionate about (unlike my friends). I know I don't want to be in academia, though I enjoyed teaching. I've also lost all passion for freshwater field work, though I suspect that might just be because of what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm unsure as to whether a change of say, study species, within ecology is all that is needed, or if ecology just isn't for me. My biggest mistake was not doing more fieldwork, either as a volunteer or as a paid technician, before going to grad school; I feel like a fool for pursuing this all for as long as I have. This field is driven on passion, and I'm not sure if I have any any longer. Having gone through my PhD, I know I need a break. I'm of two minds as to what to do next however; do I try to re-motivate myself, that is pursue technician positions abroad in different fields, or should I stop wasting time and think of pursuing a different career entirely. My age and the lack of job prospects within ecology push me toward the latter, but I also can't help but feel I just didn't go down the right path (or perhaps I'm just afraid to acknowledge it's not for me).

It's clear that it can be very difficult to know how activities like this will work out, but I find that people often take this a step further and resort to a sort of folk ignorance, where they assume that interventions/activities will *predictably* backfire and make things worse. You might compare this to folk economic beliefs, where people believe that markets are perfect and any government intervention is going to bungle things up. Proponents of changing the ecosystem are perceived as having a sort of technological hubris that inevitably leads to ruin. 

I think this phenomenon would end if people understood two ideas that I think are relatively uncontroversial among ecologists (correct me if I'm wrong) and I'd like to know if there are studies that might shed light on how to communicate them to the public, or just your experience/recommendations:

1. An action to change an ecosystem might achieve its desired ends just as easily as it might backfire, and there is no guarantee that the side effects would be bad rather than good; we can't automatically predict a bad outcome. (combat excessive pessimism)

2. Scientific study can help us find actions that are probably, not 100% guaranteed, but probably, going to work. (combat anti-intellectualism)

This is where I need you, I've been looking at the research into Jaguars and the academic literature doesn't feature much information in terms of numbers. As I'm using remote sensing I ideally need a number of locations within the Amazon rainforest which have been researched (jaguar numbers) between 2000-2018 in about 15 locations to have enough data to work off. 

Does anyone know where I can find this data? Is there a database anywhere which has similar methods which shows Jaguar populations in a number of different locations within the Amazon rainforest?

83,ecology,Aspiring Field Biologist With Some Questions,"Hello everyone! So glad to have found this community.

So here is my deal:

Since 2016 I have been studying Environmental Science at my local community college. As I took classes I found that I was more interested in biotic factors of the environment. A lot of jobs associated with the major didn't resonate with me. 

This year I realized that I won't be graduating within a reasonable timeframe- the way my credits added up it would take me another two years to graduate. This means that I would be getting an associate's in the amount of time most people achieve their bachelor's degree.

One of my professors set me up with a master's student studying Northern Pine Snakes. I became her assistant over two weeks in June to make sure I actually wanted to pursue field research. The work pushed me to some limits (heat, 13+ hour days, etc.) but I loved every second of it. I now have over 100 hours of fieldwork under my belt and am gathering labwork hours by helping a different student at the same field station. 

So what I need help with is deciding what major to pick, which college to go to, and an idea of what to expect in the industry/tips for ""getting my foot in the door"".

I tossed the idea of an ecology, EEB or conservation biology major but I feel those are too specific in a competitive field. My current plan is biology with an ecology concentration + a minor (statistics, bioinformatics, or marine biology). The biology major gives me more to fall back on in case I don't make it straight away, but of course there is the worry that I'll be learning less because of the biology focus . I am having trouble picking a minor as well.

As for colleges, I'm looking for along the east coast (so by the water) and having the programs I want + research opportunities. So far I am considering:  
**Rutgers:** In my home state and the field station I work at is partnered with them, so I have good recommendations and will likely be accepted. Pretty much my safe school.  
**University of Rhode Island:** Has the exact major I want, unique location. I e-mailed the biology head with some questions and in response he offered to CALL me, which I was very impressed by. I had a half hour long conversation with him and was impressed by what the school offered.

**Coastal Carolina University:** Beautiful area and marine science program, talked to biology department and they seemed to have good independent research oppertunities. I'm also looking at UNC: Wilmington for the same location factor.

**University of Maryland:** Someone my age at the field station goes here and said he enjoys it. Seems to be competitive, which I like and don't like at the same time. I haven't talked to their biology department yet. What drew me to the school was being close to DC may = government jobs.   

**Dartmouth:** Not as set on this school but Ivy Leagues tend to have stellar education and research centers.

**SUNY ESU:** Worth mentioning in case anyone has opinions on it but I likely won't be applying here, very pricey out of state and I'd have to restart as a freshman. It's also inland. The specific programs did peak my interest though.   

Special thanks to whoever read this! I appreciate all advice I can get.

There‚Äôs a small log cabin and a short driveway, but otherwise the full acreage is forest that‚Äôs been mostly untouched for at least 70 years, and some of the trees are about 120 years old. 

We don‚Äôt get to go to the property much, but we absolutely love it (we got engaged and married in the stream that runs through the property),so we want the land to continue to be a little nature preserve. Our goal is to have a healthy forest ecosystem on the property with as little disturbance or intervention as possible. We don‚Äôt care at all about harvesting lumber, and unless it‚Äôs absolutely necessary, we‚Äôll never cut anything down. 

The local forestry managers we‚Äôve consulted seem quite certain that we need to cut out about 40% of the trees to keep the forest healthy. That seems absolutely bonkers to us, and given the way locals think about trees here we‚Äôre pretty sure that they‚Äôre trained to manage forests to produce nice lumber rather than to maintain a healthy ecosystem. We‚Äôre not sure how healthy the forest currently is, though we do know from one forester‚Äôs assessment that there are almost no harmful pests or invasive species so it seems like there are some clear signs of good health. 

We want to help this wonderful little world flourish as much as possible, but we‚Äôre  having a difficult time finding any sort of guide that can help us assess the current health of the ecosystem, and ensure its future health.

I also have a few work experiences working for agencies related to ecology but they were technician and not technically research positions. I took a working (for agency) year off to figure out what I want to do and I have decided that I want to push towards acquiring a position as a research plant ecologist for an agency like NPS, USGS, etc. I have a PhD offer on the line which means I would be skipping a Master's but I have a sinking feeling that my CV will end up being shorter than most after graduation because I didn't take time to get more research experiences as most of my peers seem to have done. ""Everyone"" seems to have 1-4 positions at colleges or research institutes to beef up their history between. Am I being weird about this or would it be a good idea to do something as crazy as turning down a PhD to collect more experiences and maybe get a few additional publications since I want to be a career researcher?

""Human freedom is a romantic illusion, Human have never had any true freedom when it comes to the order of nature, either you align or you suffer.""- Louie the Logic Gremlin \[""...Free to make choices means without being influenced and I can't understand that at all. All of us are influenced in all our choices by the culture we live in, by our parents, and by the values that dominate. So, we're influenced. So there can't be free choices.""\] - (Jacque Fresco)  
Wow, I think the idea of the Law of Nature, actually takes away my anxiety, knowing that I am not actually ""free"", only because if you were free then everything that happened to you are of your own consequences, meaning you are fighting yourself without even knowing it, but it not yourself you are fighting but Nature, and it really have to kick you in the head when you realize that you yourself are a force of Nature, you are a part of it, what I think happened is just the illusion of separation to our Higher Power, but who can we blame for that? And if you blame, you are relinquishing your own personal power, so it is time to put fear/phobia aside and say that we are wrong and that we made many mistakes, but my goodness, that doesn't mean it can't be corrected, very soon I am going to have to come to terms with myself and say that, I truly have been brainwashed! And it is true! My thoughts on this is just simply to realize that we been raised to be slaves, I found out that slavery just got insidious, physical slavery requires the persons to be housed and fed, whereas, 'economic' slavery, it is up to you to provide yourself to be housed and fed, therefore possibly creating immense profits for our employers/owners, who have no obligation to take care of you. Well that just how it going to be played, I think I have an idea on how to get out of this slavery, so when I do, you won't be hearing from me because I have achieved liberation and would not feel the need to share it, because you wouldn't understand it, only I would hope you would achieve your own liberation, by following your own heart, and it is not easy following your own heart when society on Earth started producing drones, drones meaning people who were brought up in schools that only practice curricula of rote memorization rather than critical thinking, that have created a separation to your true emotions just because ""they"" say it not ""rational"". That not to say that critical thinking put aside our emotional aspect of yourselves, on the contrary, it will help you make informed decisions because as Spirits in the Human Flesh, critical thinking would be an integration of logical and creativity synergy within us to be more expressive, but sadly that is not the case. I mean REALLY how often do you have thoughts that are truly yours, that are of your heart, and not a by-products of so-called laws and/or rules dictated by the false idols in text books that authorities want you to know? For example, why Thomas Edison and not Nikola Tesla? Thinking outside the box wouldn't be possible unless someone else told you to, and even then you be stuck with the habit of that particular technique of out of the box thinking only to just be another rut in your pattern of thinking without coming up with your own, my point is, why couldn't I have been able to think without someone telling me how to think, like REALLY, how dangerous am I? How dangerous are You? Will we ever know, and please do not even hope that maybe when you go to Heaven you have the answers because that won't be the case, as you are reading this, this is your own reality, you can create your afterlife, unless maybe the Law of Nature decide otherwise that you either cease to exist, or reincarnate, or live for eternity in some place not of this physical realm... Some ask that would living for eternity would be of a hellish circumstance? For example, if you were able to have what you want without fail, would you start to resent that? Well, I would say that it is different to live in a physical realm and a spiritual realm, our way of thinking doesn't necessarily will be retained when we progress, our desires will always changes because Change is the only Constant, so that will explain why we in the state we are in, because we are ignorance of the Law of Nature, thus Ignorance is Evil, and Knowledge is Power. Understand the Law of Nature, and you probably be liberated, but like I said, when I achieve my Liberation, that probably would be my cue to hide behind the curtains, since that where true power resides.

60&amp;#37;, limited for 36 months

In  the scope of the interdisciplinary research  project ‚ÄúBlick in die  Zukunft (BLIZ): Wechselwirkungen zwischen  Gesellschaft, Landnutzung,  √ñkosystemleistungen und Biodiversit√§t in  Bayern bis 2100‚Äù funded by the  Bavarian Climate Research Network  (‚Äúbayklif‚Äù) of the Bavarian State  Ministry, we invite applications for  PhD position.

**Your profile**

¬ü¬† Full university degree (Diploma/M.Sc.) in biology, geo-ecology, environmental science or a related discipline

¬ü¬† Sound knowledge in mechanistic modelling and scientific programming (e.g. Matlab, R, C++) is required

¬ü¬† Ability to write scientific manuscripts, communicate concepts and results in fluent English

¬ü¬† Good communication skills and the ability to work in a team

Tasks

You  will be a team member of the recently started  interdisciplinary  research project ‚ÄúBLIZ‚Äù. Together with partners from  the TUM,  University of Regensburg and FAU Erlangen, you investigate the  dynamics  of freshwater biodiversity. The project will focus on the   spatiotemporal dynamics of populations and communities of freshwater   plants in Bavarian lakes. Initial study systems will be the Iffeldorfer   lakes and model development as well as ecophysiological calibration  will  be done in close collaboration with partners in the Limnological   Station Iffeldorf (TUM; [www.fisch.wzw.tum.de/](http://www.fisch.wzw.tum.de/)).  With the model, you will  investigate the feedbacks between freshwater  biodiversity and  socio-economic systems (land-use change) in a changing  climate and their  uncertainties. The main goal of the project is to  develop adaptation  strategies to maintain sustainable ecological  systems and to avoid  tipping points. Specific tasks of the PhD position  are (1) to develop  and apply process-based models for freshwater  macrophytes at the local  scale (e.g. lake), (2) to simulate impacts of  land-use and climate  change on important native macrophyte species and  relevant invasive  species, and (3) to evaluate potential risks for  biodiversity and  develop sustainable management strategies. The  doctoral thesis will be  done as a series of English manuscripts. ¬†

**Our offer**

¬ü¬† Stimulating working environment and an interdisciplinary research team

¬ü¬† A salary in accordance to the position will be limited to 36 months

¬ü¬†  JMU is an equal opportunity employer. Qualified  women are therefore  particularly encouraged to apply. Applicants with  disabilities are  treated with preference given comparable qualification.

You don‚Äôt hear about elephant herds having a multigenerational family rivalry over prime grazing grounds, to the point where they conquer and exterminate other herds. Conversely, you don‚Äôt hear about human mothers finding someone trying to kill their nine-year-old child, kicking the assailant in the head and just letting them run to their car.

Are humans just better at critical thinking (if I kill her, she won‚Äôt come back vs. out of sight, out of mind)? Do animals not realize the intent to kill on the emotional level a human does? Maybe it‚Äôs animal‚Äôs lack of a collective culture and group mentality?",1531019026

This is a pretty small little lake. It's wide, there's a good amount of room for the trout to swim around. But it's basically just a pond, probably has a diamter of 10 m if I had to guess. 

And yet there are all these full grown trout in there. Which makes me figure, there has got to be a real abundance of aquatic invertebrates to support this many full sized fish in that pond. 

It kind of just boggles my head a bit because I imagine what it would take to have an aquarium for example that feeds fish without any external food inputs on a similar space to fish ratio as what was going on there.

The problem is understood pretty well with eucalypts transported to other regions, e.g., S. Africa and Kenya.  Both nations are removing these ""thirsty trees.""


&gt;Since 1935 South Africa has been researching timber plantations...due to complaints when rivers downstream of plantations starting running dry. ....Eucalypts....because of their ability to grow deep roots...(and transpiration capacity) are able to ‚Äúmine‚Äù soil water, or desiccate a catchment.

Does this problem/phenomenon ever occur with native tree species?

And the broad statement below seems provocative.  The notion that trees help environments by reducing run-off and slowing erosion is one of our basic ecological narratives.

 ""Water management programmes across the developing world are based on the mistaken belief that trees increase the available water in an area, says a report ....Forests tend to diminish water supplies because they lose more water through evaporation than other vegetation, say the researchers.""

I'm currently analyzing community composition data from fish trawls conducted in a bay, collected before and after the decline of a major biogenic habitat in the bay. I'm using the R package ""vegan"" to conduct some of my analyses. One of the things I'd like to do with the data is generate estimates of species richness, diversity, and evenness, but there isn't equal replication between groups. For species richness, that isn't a problem, as I was able to estimate asymptotic species richness for each group using vegan's ""specpool\`"" function.

The problem is that I haven't been able to find a function to estimate biodiversity using the asymptotic species richness. Since diversity is based on both species richness and evenness, you'd think that diversity indices calculated on groups with different sample sizes would not be comparable. However, as far as I know, the diversity indices generated by vegan's ""diversity"" function are based on the observed number of species, not the asymptotic species richness. Does anyone know if there's a way to estimate diversity such that the estimates are comparable across groups with different sample sizes? Thanks!",1526958442

If I'm understanding the flyer correctly, these positions will be open to qualified biologists who have graduated within the last two years. I'm not sure if they will only be open to this group or not.

All the positions will be hired through four vacancy announcements on USA Jobs, open from May 17 - 31. If you're interested in applying, I would recommend creating a USA Jobs profile now (if you don't have one) and start updating your resume.

However, recently the local government has decided to start a project where they install new pipelines underground but this project will also destroy the creek and the forested area around it, where many animals and plants live. Not only this, but the other construction projects around the city have shown little to no regard for the environment around it and blatantly destroy everything around it. 

I was wondering if anybody here has any advice about anything our neighborhood might be able to do to prevent this, or at least give the project some oversight to prevent as much destruction as possible. It would be an absolute shame to have so many animals dislocated and the creek destroyed, and I would like to be able to know if there is anything possible to prevent it.

I have been presented with 3 hypothetical regions that have been run through FRAGSTATS to produce a multitude of patch metrics, class metrics, and landscape metrics. Now I have to decide which of the 3 areas is best to reintroduce a specific species into (its a real species). 

So now I have to do a bit of a lit review on the ecology/habitat preferences of the species, but I can't really seem to connect the dots. Can anyone point me in the direction of learning how to decide what metrics to use?

I have a bit of an idea. For example, I'm going to find its home range size and dispersal capabilities. And from this I can decide if the species needs one large habitat area- if it has a large home-range and poor dispersal abilities- or if it can persist in fragmented habitat as it might have a high dispersal ability. Additionally, I can look at its edge-sensitivity, so then I can compare area:edge ratios of the proposed regions to influence my decision.

Am I thinking about this correctly?",1524708140

I would like to investigate the species richness and/or abundance of Silphids, however I'm not settled on whether this will be for an urban to rural gradient or simply to show the effects of fragmentation. I need to decide if I'm studying a gradient effect from rural to urban with line transects or simply using a stratified grid system within forests of various patch sizes or simply at distinct urban forest and semi-natural forest sites. I'm leaning more toward the latter two as I should be able to achieve adequate randomness but equal coverage and I have some good papers which highlight the effect that woodland size has on these beetles. I'm also not as familiar with line transects and gradients. It comes down to these two:

-grid pitfall traps a distinct urban forests compared with semi-natural forest

or

-grid pitfall traps in various fragmented forest patches in an urban area.

But I'm not sure which is workable. There are a lot of options. It may be that line transects are what I need. Any help would be extremely appreciated.",1523017604

36,ecology,Have an assignment about why desert arthropods are found in vegetated areas and not in open unvegetated microhabitats.,"So I need to propose an experiment to test my hypothesis.

So far, I have three hypothesis:

* Vegetated regions provide shade to these desert arthropods

* Vegetated regions provide more nutrients to these arthropods (decaying plant matter for species of beetles).

* Vegetated regions make it easier for these arthropods to burrow into the sand, because the roots make the soil loose.

So my assignment is to write an experiment to test one of these hypothesis. The one I want to test out is the last one, the one about there being more burrows in vegetated regions versus unvegetated regions.

The thing is, I don't know how to approach this experiment logistically. If I want to test the effect vegetation has on soil, I'd have to the control for the effects of shade/temperature and nutrient to prevent these from becoming confounding variables for my results. I really don't know how I would control the amount of nutrients in a patch of soil nor keep the temperature constant. 

To prove my hypothesis, I would also have to show that there are more burrows in vegetated regions when compared to unvegetated. I was thinking of digigng up a standardized area of soil in both vegetated/unvegetated regions and counting the number of burrows found in this area. Thing is, I'm not sure whether or not the burrows of the desert arthropods can be found. Some burrows are covered and some are deeper into the sand. And if I did find burrows, how could I know they were created by a desert arthropod and not a rodent? Are there any distinctive features of burrows created by desert arthropods?

I would like some help or suggestions about what I can do to improve my experiment.

Besides the obvious presence of and access to the environments themselves and the experience they have to offer, I feel like I can only say that we'd permanantly lose the benefits of organisms that we don't currently have where we can farm it outside of nature, be it discovered or undiscovered. I know drilling for oil, as well as transporting it, tends to pollute fresh water supplies, and I'm assuming a sudden mega-dump of dead organisms in and around said water supplies would make them difficult if not impossible to subsist on (correct me if I'm wrong about that, though). Then there's also the unsustainably fast consumption of water that the scenario in my head would entail, which I'm assuming would result in something like mass death by starvation/dehydration at some point.

Forest gardening or food forests is a system of gardening that incorporates different trees and plants that produce yields which can be eaten or can be used by humans. Most plants in the forest garden are multipurpose and is aimed to be perennial which allows the forest to be highly sustainable. To improve ecosystem health, diversity is also important. Different species of plants give mutual benefit to each other which allows the plants to take care of themselves (Crawford, M. (2014).

We don't want to throw away our hypothesis just yet, so we were wondering if anyone here know if there is a noticeable difference in ground-level water turbulence as you go further away from the shoreline. Alternatively, we noticed that surface sediment size varies quite a bit within the bay that we looked at, so could that potentially reflect differences in wave turbulence in different spots of the bay, or am I grasping at straws here.

But I do currently have pets that I‚Äôm trying to keep if at all possible. So for those of you that have worked here: how frequently are you gone overnight and do you have to camp for extended periods of time?

Did you work as a lead temp, temp, or something else? I have a B.S. so trying to decide which position to apply for. 

I would also be interested in hearing any general experiences and which domain you worked in, as well as which field (thinking about botany myself).

16,ecology,Need to choose between Yale and a cheaper state school for ecology-- need help planning my future and managing careers/debt in general.,"So my college decision is likely going to boil down to two schools: Yale and the UC Davis honors program. The former is likely going to lead to about 40,000 dollars in debt (maybe less depending on what scholarships I can swing) and the latter is going to be approximately the value of my college fund.

There are a few benefits to each-- Yale is obviously an Ivy League school, and will likely provide easier funding opportunities and smaller classes, allowing me to explore the field better or change if I find ecology is not to my liking. There is also a route to a 1-year masters degree in forestry or environmental science at Yale's grad school. However, Davis will likely provide nearly the same level of coursework and will be 40-50k cheaper total, albeit more distanced from the professors (though the honors program mitigates this slightly). I may also be able to save a modest sum for graduate education.

Do you think people care about what undergrad you go to for ecology? Will the brand name help me in job searching? I am aware I likely need at least a Masters. In addition I am pretty worried about my career prospects in ecology, as the average salary seems to be around 60k. Am I able to make a middle class lifestyle, regardless of which college I choose, if I continue down this path?

Of course, I would like to find a lucrative permanent position (which is of course as likely as discovering a unicorn). Out of the two options, which way does this sub think will help me more? I know that ultimately it's my decision but if anyone has experience in either program I would be happy to hear from them.

Thanks!",1518900508

A colleague does the same job, and we have been to India, Thailand, Malaysia and such, just to mention the interesting countries for this topic.

Compared to western habits, the awareness of climate change, pollution etc is close to non-existant in these countries, and all I saw was just the daily rhythm of life (nothing on industrial level for instance).
Some examples : you get a McDonalds meal, they will give you a separate plastic bag for your drink. Waste recycling and selective storing : never seen that here, apart from glass sometimes. Trash cans in the street : rarest, therefore people will throw their junk on the ground rather than keep it to throw away later.

So what can I do, a little white boi in the wild? Well it's not much but it's something : trying to KEEP the same habits you'd have in Europe or the U.S. 
Ask for no plastic bag at the cashier, do not throw away anything in the streets, don't take 10 straws when you need 2 etc.
And you have to be proactive, you have to say ""no bag please"" cause by default you will have one, or two, or three. When you do this kind of move, it also has an effect on the people here, they will remember it. 

Why such a lengthy post for something like that that seems so obvious? Because it's hard to keep those habits. Believe it or not, but when you have no trash cans anywhere, and everyone around you just throws away in the street, it is REALLY tempting to do the same (experienced by a group of friends in the Philippines). So stay aware of our planet's situation even abroad, where people don't know about it as much as we do! Spread the word, it's little effect but it matters!

40,ecology,Why did the Siberian Tiger not cross the Bering Strait Land-bridge?,"I honestly do not know the answer to this. I am asking to see if someone in the community has the answer or at least a plausible theory. Just off the cuff I would speculate that the tiger was locked out of northern Sibera by other large predators, for example Smilodon (Saber Tooth). By the time these other large predators became extinct or no longer a threat the land bridge had already submerged.

But upon further reflection this first theory does not seem that plausible to me. The co-existence of multiple species of large predators in a single ecosystem is not that unusual.

More likely the expansion of the Siberian tiger from its homeland in Southern Asia just coincidentally occurred after the land bridge had already be severed.

I did acoustic monitoring of bats for my project. I had about 100,000 bat calls (""call"" determined by the monitor settings) and lost about 70% of those raw calls. I wrote down weekly totals of calls by detector (I ran two detectors every week), but I have about 10 out of 32 weeks of raw file data. I made graphs looking at average nightly activity (number of calls v. hour) and % of species present (both with raw data). I also made a graph looking at overall activity trends (number of calls v. week), another for activity relative to weather (number of calls per week v. rainfall/wind/humidity), and another for activity by habitat type (number of calls per week v. habitat). 

How would I even go about explaining this in the methods? Should I call the raw file data a subset? Should I specify what specific weeks the raw file data is from?

6,ecology,Advice for home range estimation method - reptile study,"Hi there,
I'm doing a study on the movement of reptiles, and have been overwhelmed with the differing techniques for calculating home range size.
MCP seems outdated however am considering using this for comparisons with other studies. 
I am looking for a Kernel Density Estimation to use in addition that would suit my study
I am using VHF transmitters to track the animals, getting 3-4 locations per animal per day, and will have 50-60 points for each animal by the end of the study.
If anyone can give some insight or link to resources to make this choice a bit easier it would be appreciated!!",1515025766

8,ecology,Physical Chemistry graduate student contemplating career change.,"Hi all,

I am a third year graduate student in physical chemistry. As I have worked through my graduate studies, I have had some experiences and learned/admitted some things about myself as one does. One of those things is that I love to be outside, and I care much more about the environment and nature than I do about the field I currently study. It is very esoteric, does not have much potential for real applications, and worst of all it requires me to spend all day, every day either at my computer, in a wet laboratory, or in a laser lab, which is a dark, cold room filled with very sensitive microscopes (for good reason, but ugh).

I have decided definitively to leave the program, but am undecided on whether I would like to return to academia to study ecology. From my understanding, this field is most closely associated with the problems and questions I would like to solve and study, and provides some of the best opportunity to work outside. 

So, here are some of my questions regarding this field:

1) How likely am I to be accepted into a group, provided my lack of knowledge of biology and ecology? I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, programming, writing, microscopy and laboratory research, and am willing to take any remedial classes necessary provided it is not another entire bachelor's degree and I can afford to do it. 

2) Will I actually have opportunities to work outside? How often? How dependent is this on the group?

3) What can I do in the short term (a year or so) to make myself attractive to potential PI's? 

4) Are there other avenues besides academia to get into this field? Is it feasible that I could be hired on at a state park or national park with my background?

5) Does the emotional toll of watching humanity screw plants and animals out of their homes and habitats affect job satisfaction in a disastrous way?

6) How transferable is NSF funding?????

Thanks all for your replies, and if any clarification is needed please let me know.

For anyone who knows about or works with Riparian Zones; I was hoping you could help me out. 

I. Is there a system or standard for your area that helps determine the width/length, and even depth of a riparian buffer? or is it a case by case situation?

II. Once you find a damaged or limited Riparian zone, are there artificial methods to repair it? I.e. fencing or redirecting stream flow? 

I'm mainly thinking in terms of if you have a stream with limited room to function (lets say near an expressway). 

III. How important is it if the water is lentic (stagnant) or lotic (moving)? 

Thanks for your help. I'm not doing a project or anything, merely brushing up.

The [retraction message] (http://colubroid.org/) (he terms it a 'correction', but it essentially repudiates the main points of the original): 

To summarize, the original piece used some valid points (invasive species sometimes raise diversity, all species go extinct, etc.) to advance a poor argument, and one that's essentially non-scientific. To illustrate, here are a few lines from the piece: 

&gt;""The only reason we should conserve biodiversity is for ourselves, to create a stable future for human beings.""

&gt;""But the impulse to conserve for conservation‚Äôs sake has taken on an unthinking, unsupported, unnecessary urgency.""

&gt;""[...] extinction does not carry moral significance, even when we have caused it.""

This piece upset biologists around the world, many of whom are presently writing responses to this piece. The author now states in his correction/retraction: 

&gt;I cavalierly glossed over several complex issues in a way that did not represent them accurately or enhance a robust, consequential debate. Regardless of particular arguments I made regarding when and where biodiversity conservation is necessary or appropriate, I fully support both legislative and scientific efforts for conservation and preservation of biodiversity. I have researched the effects of climate change and extinction risk on reptiles and amphibians for over a decade. I am saddened by the fragmentation of habitat and the decline of the planet's amazing biodiversity at the numerous field sites I have visited. In no way do I condone extinction, or the exploitation of the natural environment, for short-term gain.

I state 'perhaps unintentionally' in the post title to give him the benefit of the doubt, because he also states:

&gt;In particular, the headlines inserted for the piece for publication said ""We don't need to save endangered species,"" and that ""we should only worry about preserving biodiversity when it helps us."" I did not write these words, I do not believe these things, and I do not support them.",1512321746

I think this is a good addition for my question, but I'm not sure what an appropriate, and ideally non-arbitrary cutoff would be for considering a tiller to be a member of the understory versus canopy. So, relative to the tallest plant around, how short would a plant need to be to be considered part of the understory? Obviously, a tree that is only 10cm shorter than the tallest shouldn't be considered part of the understory, but where is the threshold?

I have heard one explanation that made a bit of sense for forests... that if the top of the plant reaches the bottom of the ""umbrella"" of the canopy, it's part of it, but the more I think about it, the more problematic that idea becomes, both personally, and in general. In general, I would think that would extend the ""umbrella"" to the bottom of the plant in question, ultimately making every plant a canopy plant. To me personally,  since I work with grasses the concept of the umbrella would often extend to the soil surface.

I hope that this makes sense and is perhaps interesting.

As for Maths I scraped it but haven't used it much since and my skills are quite poor. I have a natural interest in nature but also a penchant for writing and research, which is naturally (no pun intended) why I'm interested in Ecology. I've also became very aware of global environmental issues within recent years which contributed to dramatic lifestyle changes such as adopting a vegan diet.

Basically I'm willing to go and do a Bachelors undergraduate degree all over again in order to get into this. The issue is, in order to become an ecologist, am I going to need to be good at maths? Most of the outright 'Ecology' courses I looked at include it, but many Environmental Science ones don't... Personally I'd love to discover more about botany and I have a PADI scuba diving license so discovering more about marine biology would also be cool.

[Ecosia](https://info.ecosia.org/what): Ecosia is a search engine built off of Bing and other existing services. The search engine will then display ads at the top of the search, like Google and Bing already do, and the money gained from clicking these ads goes to several reforestry projects across the world. Generally whenever I see the ads, I'll open them in a new tab and then quickly close them when I found the website I'm actually looking for. In [August 2017](http://documents.ecosia.org/369415/12019080), they raised almost $400,000 for tree projects around the world!

[Tab For a Cause](http://tab.gladly.io/): This service changes your tabbing experience so that when you open a new tab, two ads are placed in the bottom right half of your screen. Every tab generates hearts, which then allows you to decide where the ad revenue goes. You are also able to made additions to the page, create bookmarks tiles, and add widgets to the new tab page.

Odum has slightly different requirements that have increased the amount of credits I need to graduate from 36 to 45+. Sidenote: I would also like to attend Grad school after getting my Bachelors. 

This essentially moves my projected graduation date from winter 2018 to summer 2019, which consequently, If I go to grad school, extends that time as well.

I could stay at GSU, finish my undergrad in Biology and still end up working somewhere in the umbrella of Ecology. 

Or I could go to Odum, a smaller school which has courses tailored to Ecology, but ultimately stay in school longer than intended. 

My dream job would probably be working with a team in the field. I plan of taking some GIS courses, and may even get Scuba certifications. 

So really, I'm reaching out for opinions/advice/thoughts on this matter and would appreciate it if some working Ecologists/Biologists chimed in on this!

However, when doing some extra reading around the subject, at least at the general level, it seems to me that there should be no reason why they cannot apply to populations at larger sizes.

My understanding is that Allee effects are simply the relationship between the mean fitness of a population and the size or density of the population. Sure, it is easier and more effective to use small populations as an example, e.g: small populations tend to suffer from inbreeding depression and mate limitation, which is where the mean fitness drops being the ""Allee effect"".  But my question is, can this be said for large populations where a similar ""effect"" is seen when populations get too big and start causing declines in mean fitness due to competition for resources and space?

I have two questions regarding the following text:

**""Interaction dynamics revealed how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides) as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8 patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds (avg. 2.3√ó faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to evasion in light of the mean 1.6√ó higher mass-specific energetic costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 vs. 1.29 kJ kg‚àí1 min‚àí1, respectively). On an instantaneous basis, escapes were more costly for pumas, requiring exercise at ‚â•90% of predicted VÃá O2MAXVÃáO2MAX and consuming as much energy per minute as approximately 5 min of active hunting.""**

I'm a student interested in ecology and environmental science in general, and I came across this quote by E.O. Wilson (who has been an inspiration of mine for many years) in a copy of the Scientific American. He says:

&gt;The greatest cause of species extinction is loss of habitat. That is why I‚Äôve stressed an assembled global reserve occupying half the land and half the sea, as necessary, and in my book Half-Earth, I show how it can be done. With this initiative (and the development of a far better species-level ecosystem science than the one we have now), it will also be necessary to discover and characterize the 10 million or so species estimated to remain; we‚Äôve only found and named two million to date. Overall, an extension of environmental science to include the living world should be, and I believe will be, a major initiative of science during the remainder of this century.

What does he mean, specifically, when he says ""the development of a far better species-level ecosystem science"", as well as ""an extension of environmental science to include the living world""? Is he just talking about finding and learning about presently unknown species? If so, what positive effects would this have?

Recently I finished an experiment I now I'm in doubt what statistic approach would be appropriate.  
Basically I took samples of diptera coming through the windows of two farms, on two day a week, for four constitutive weeks, once in spring and once late summer. The hypothesis is, that the diptera prefer some stable side/windows to enter and leave to other sides/windows.  
I had a decent number of traps but I guess traps in the same window are just pseudo replicates and should be treated as one big trap, so my replicates come from repetition.  
My first impulse would be to use an ANOVA (with  Individuals ~ Season + Week + Farm + StableSide + Window) but I don't think an ANOVA is appropriate for count data. So I hope you might have some ideas, all input is appreciated!

Should I consider this a beneficial native plant for wildlife, or would planting it be no better than some cultivated exotic flower like chrysanthemums?

My question would also extend towards other North American natives like purple poppy mallow (Callirhoe involucrata), queen of the prairie (Filipendula rubra), ozark witch hazel (Hamamelis vernalis), desert bluebells (Phacelia campanulari), and california poppies (Eschscholzia californica).

I'm a student (junior) that is finishing up a degree in Ecology &amp; Conservation. I began working in an entomology lab on campus about a year back when I was a sophmore, and my lab recommended me to a *massive* USDA project. They originally were offering me a full time lab tech position (30k+ starting salary with benefits and a 401k) at 40 hours a week. I told them however that I just couldn't do that much work on top of school, and I would need to put my GPA and degree first (I haven't ruled out graduate school yet, so not getting overworked is important to me and my GPA). 

They called me back and offered for me to work 20-25 hours a week at $15 an hour. Not gangbusters money, but it pays 3 bucks an hour more than what I make at the entomology lab (where I'm restricted to 20 hours a week). 

My job would be as a lab technician, which I fully assume to just translate to largely grunt work of cleaning, feeding (it's a breeding facility), and pretty low totem work. 

Does anybody have any experience working for the USDA in any similar capacity? I know there seems to be a large hiring freeze federally, but is this a good option for growing my resume? Has anyone had any experience with good upward mobility from lab tech jobs like this?

I feel good about getting to work for the USDA as a lab tech as a Junior in college, but I just want to see if this is somewhere I should put a lot of hope into for potentially long term employment after graduation, or if I should just view it as a temporary place.

Apart from biodiversity concerns like dwindling bird species' populations, what do people here think about the suffering inflicted?

The prey aren't eaten and are instead just left to rot, so it would seem like that causes a lot of unnecessary suffering and loss of life. But that prey is then eaten by insects and smaller animals who happen upon it. If that prey wasn't there, it seems like they'd have to get their food from other, smaller animals and that could entail more suffering (because one large corpse would have to be substituted with many smaller ones, so there's be lots more suffering and loss of life).

I know part of the answer depends on how sentient and capable of suffering insects and smaller animals are, as compared to the larger prey which cats kill, but I'm curious how ecologists would think about this.",1503568341

Is the day-to-day for an average Ethologist that different from an Ecologist with their respective jobs in the field? How do all you guys come to the conclusion e.g. ""I want to be an Ornithologist"" as opposed to just studying Animal Behavior in general?

I'm considering making a general life change and I'd like to gather as much info as possible, here. Some notes which may contain pertinent information about myself:

Currently 29 y/o, well out of college with a BA in a completely unrelated field. My interest in the natural world has historically not been limited to -- but has largely revolved around -- animals and their behavior. Approximately 33% of my free time in the last six months has been dedicated to reading on specifics of different bird species, and reading (and re-reading) anecdotes of Konrad Lorenz and his water-shrew + Dysticus-larvae-containing life. 

Instead of my recent internship (in another completely unrelated field) taking off, it sort of stagnating to a halt, and I'm considering my options. I feel like if I could have an avenue to pursue an education, and ultimately, career, where I'm simultaneously able to learn more about the natural world and spread important ideas/information about wildlife &amp; environmental conservation, I'd strongly consider that option.

There are caveats... My college G.P.A. wasn't good ('11 graduation), I studied largely irrelevant areas, and I'd potentially like to stay in WA state (even better, the greater Seattle area. I do understand if this is way too limiting).

54,ecology,Environmental Consultant? and other job prospects with an Ecology degree (x-post from /r/careerguidance),"I've been attending a bridging service to work/education after being a NEET for many years, dropping out of high school and living a very secluded and depressive lifestyle. After assessing my interests and what motivates me, I was advised to look into Environmental Consultation (or something along those lines), essentially, helping businesses to be greener.

This seems ideal for me, as I am less motivated to get up in the morning by money as I am about doing something that benefits the earth/society. The career path would apparently be:

Access course to sciences [biological/chemical) (1 yr) -&gt; Ecology (4yrs Honors) [or Environmental Health/Geology/Geography/Chemistry] -&gt; Environmental Sustainability (1yr Masters) [or Environmental Management/Environmental Sciences]


I have no experience in this area at the moment to be honest, I would be starting from zero, but I could see myself being very motivated in this line of education if I could see my career being of benefit to the environment. The 6 year job forecast is +3.5%, salary is from 16k-41k, though there are only 3,178 people employed in this field in my area (Scotland). Given the few jobs in that area, it's not something I would pin all my hopes on. If I complete an Ecology degree, then move onto an Environmental Sustainability or similar degree, what other job prospects are there at the end of this line of education, are there other more plentiful jobs in this area? This is something I'm waiting to speak about with a careers advisor, but I'd like to get as much information as possible beforehand as well. My bridging service provider also mentioned Environmental Law/Politics, which would be I think mostly Ecology with some lighter reading on law.



Alternatively, if there are few jobs in this path, I would also be interested in any education/jobs in Green Energy, though engineering or advanced science-based jobs would probably be above my level. Ultimately I would be looking for job satisfaction, and to be able to feel I was contributing positively to the world.


Currently I am on welfare, and am looking into how this would change if I were to seek full time education in the UK. I've been told I may be able to get a grant or fee waiver for these courses, while possibly still receiving welfare or a bursary. There is a possibility I may not be able to receive benefits and study full-time though (part time is more likely, but would take double the amount of years), so it may make more sense to look into a career path that I can start becoming financially independent sooner. However, given my null employment history, it would be difficult to find employment with only low-level qualifications.


Additionally my meyers-briggs personality type is ISTJ.

66,ecology,"Are we properly assessing the danger of shark attack, put in context of how we view human-animal relations with our 4 most dangerous predators: Nile and salt water crocodiles, lions and tigers?","One must first grant that much data suggest that sharks are not nearly as dangerous as any of the four.  

An attempt at a hierarchy of ""dangerousness"" in animals is helpful.  Generally, the two crocodile species, very dangerous to anything that enters their waters when they are hungry,  can be termed to have a rating of 95-100  (scale of 100).  Tigers, with their proclivity to become serial killers, probably rank in the 80s.  Lions--it is harder to generalize about their (multiple) reasons for becoming man-eaters--probably rank in the 40s.  All four attack with the intent to eat people.

Black bears and cougars rarely attack man; their danger rating is about .05 to .1 out of 100.  Sharks, speaking aggregately about the three most dangerous species *(great white, tiger and bull),* probably rank 5-10.  Sometimes sharks eat people, mostly not.  

*(The fact that an animal that regularly attacks humans but does not feed on us is not really a mitigating factor.  Grizzlies rarely eat people.  But when grizzlies roamed California in the thousands up until the mid-1800s, these aggressive, sometimes irritable, animals regularly attacked humans for a variety of reasons.  Grizzlies' danger ranking is probably similar to sharks.)*

A fair number of shark conservationists characterize the danger of sharks as similar to that of black bears and cougars.  Of little threat to people.  

One of their main points of evidence:  Sharks attack only about 100 people a year.  ""Rare events,"" as they put it.

This is misleading.  Lions *kill* about 100 people a year.  Tigers generally kill fewer than 80 people a year.  But regarding the big cats, there is no confusion as to what these low numbers mean.  Today less than 2,300 tigers roam India.  Before the mid-1800s, when modern rifles came into use, India‚Äôs 50,000 tigers were killing several thousand people a year.  Similar story with the history of lion and crocodile fatalities in Africa.  

*Upshot:*  A low general risk of attack from a reduced population of dangerous animals is much different from animals being of only moderate (or minor) danger to humans.  

Shark experts tell us that humans kill tens of millions of sharks a year.  Might this population reduction affect the ‚Äúabout 100 attacks a year‚Äù rate?  Just a little bit?  Perhaps a great deal? 

*(An additional factor here: fewer large fish.  Because sharks (and marlin, some tuna, etc.) are long-lived, fisheries of the past 150 plus years have disproportionately removed from populations large, aging individuals.  The data are clear here.  Fair to say that existing shark populations worldwide are not near as dangerous to man as would be the case in a state of nature.  Exceptionally large sharks--they pose a significant danger--are rare now.)*

Is it fair to say that the hysteria from the *Jaws* phenomenon prompted a needed educational correction from shark conservationists?  (Yes.) But that now this education campaign has morphed into a PR effort--see Chris Neff's ""rebranding sharks"" program--to deny that sharks pose anything more than a minor threat to humans?

And that facts do not support the contention that sharks are only minimally dangerous?

https://saveourseas.com/project/rebranding-sharks/

https://www.saveourseasmagazine.com/the-politics-of-sharks-attacks/

*(An allied topic I will not discuss now is the repeated assertion by many shark conservationists that culling--reducing shark numbers--does not reduce the incidence of attack.  Yes it does, if conducted in the manner that Natal Sharks Board has done.)*

In my research ants are considered super organisms because they are able to divide labor between the colony. A super-organism has a trait where a multitude of individuals work together in a self-sustaining social unit. 

So.. if I defined community as: a variety of organism populations who are inhabiting the same area at the same time. Interactions between species are also the building blocks in defining a biological community. 

I want say yes, in a way, that a community could be a super organism because with out keystone species ecosystems suffer.. and the trophic structure is like a division of labor in a sense.. maybe?

I am working for a small park district that might be attempting to restore an Oak Savanna in the midwest. I am looking around to put together a protocol for vegetation surveys targeting species diversity. I believe this will be a good way, among other reasons, to track the success of the restoration.

When I look online I do see established national standards like the AIM strategy at the bureau of land management. This might be feasible, but it might not be as funding and available personal change over time.

Does anyone have any suggestions about efficient protocol that can be used to track species diversity and possibly abundance for one Oak Savanna restoration on a plot that is about 14 acres?

34,ecology,Trying to understand soil and agriculture and their future better for myself. A few questions.,"So, I'm thinking about soil as a resource tell me if what I've got here is more or less in the right direction.

Powdered rock is created by gradual forces breaking down big rocks. This powdered rock (assuming the big rocks were made of the right variety of materials) contains the building blocks of life. If there's appropriate light, water, air, and rock (powdered for most plants) then life can/will grow there. Usually this starts with mosses etc. which can contribute to the breakdown of the big rocks.

As mosses and other early plants that require little to no organic matter (only rock) grow and die, they leave behind small amounts of dead organic matter (soil). As more rock breaks down and is used by early small plants, more and more soil is created until small-but-bigger-than-moss plants can take root. They help break down some of the rock below the surface of soil and themselves eventually die and become more soil. This continues until you have a thick layer of soil that deep as the deepest tree roots. So that's how soil forms, roughly?

And then soil is degraded, two major ways coming to mind: erosion and agriculture. Erosion happens naturally, and slowly, taking dead organic matter/soil gradually out to the oceans. Presumably slower than or at the same pace as the creation of new soil. Humans can increase rates of erosion by deforestation and agriculture and cities etc. Further, aside from increasing erosion, agriculture also degrades soil by extracting the useful parts and then taking those parts away rather than having them die and reintegrate into the soil. Those useful parts become food which humans eat which goes through our sewage systems into rivers and into oceans. So instead of recycling our sewage as fertilizer to replinish the soil, we deplete the soil by dumpin our sewage off the land entirely.

The rate of soil organic matter depletion due to agriculture and human-induced erosion is waaaay higher than normal so we are running out of healthy soil to grow food in (especially given greater populations and thus greater needs for food). As a result of lacking healthy soil, on a mass scale we are using artificial fertilizers that feed the plants in the mostly dead nutient-empty rock-powder. Those artificial fertilizers rapidly wash away into rivers and eventually the ocean needing constant replacement.

At this point, we may as well move to pure hydroponics right? Take a big corn field. Build a horizontal nft hydro system or something there. Still apply the artificial fertilizers and use rain water, but at least now you can recycle the water and fertilizers and conserve those resources. Vertically farming is something people talk about too - if we taxed land and not buildings we could incentivize it. But energy to run the lights and temperature and humidity control in a vertical indoor farm would be extremely expensive - it might be cheaper for now to just do horizontal hydroponic farming where we currently do traditional horizontal industrial farming. Other people talk about moving back toward organic farming or permaculture farming horizontally instead of toward horizontal hydroponics. But IDK if those can solve the problem. Those two focus on rebuilding the long-term health of the soil so we don't have to keep making the artificial fertilizer. Is artificial fertilizer bad then? Of course if it's made of fossil fuels then it's eventually going to run out. Is that why people object to using artificial fertilizer over organic sourced fertilizers? Or is there something else?

But even if we don't like the artificial fertilizer, we could use organically sourced fertilizers (maybe made from sewage, animal manure, and 'green manure'/useless plant parts from agricultural fields) in liquid form to pour on a field or put into a horizontal hydroponic system.

What are your thoughts on all this? Contemporary Industrial Farming (useless soil) or Hydroponics (no soil) or Organic/Permaculture (healthy soil) and why? Horizontal or Vertical farming and why?

I appreciate your thoughts and would love to have a chat about this.

Edit:

So the idea behind the horizontal hydroponics approach is that you don't have to worry about maintaining healthy soil anymore at all and you could dramatically reduce the amount of water and fertilizer needed for crops. The idea behind horizontal organic/permaculture is to get back to maintaining a healthy soil to reduce the amount of water and fertilizer needed for crops. But which is the better choice? Are there other practical environmental reasons to pick one over the other if we compare them as horizontal farming methods using land that is presently used by contemporary industrial agriculture?

Edit2:

OK OK. I have another ecology question I want to ask. People say the problem with over application of fertilizers (whether manure/organic or synthetic/artificial) is that they run off into the rivers and then the oceans creating algae blooms and thus dead zones. Do these algae blooms and dead zones threaten the stability of the ocean ecosystem in a way that threatens humans in a serious way? Of course they might kill off all the fish but that doesn't present a catastrophic threat even if it would suck and be awful. Don't these algae blooms created by mass fertilizer run-off actually help sequester carbon due to all the extra photosynthesis happening and then dropping the dead algae to the bottom of the ocean?",1500308518
35,ecology,While acknowledging that r/ecology has been swamped with posts seeking career advice... I need career advice.,"I just graduated with an M.S. in ecology and I'm having a very difficult time finding employment.

**Background:** I received my B.S. in general chemistry in 2008 with a fairly mediocre GPA. After searching for a couple of years I found employment in a chemistry position in 2011, but hey, turns out I'm not a great chemist and I was fired after a year and a half (although my former manager is one of my [positive] references). By that point I had matured a bit and was ready to give school another shot, although I wanted to move into a biological science. In 2013 I enrolled in SUNY-ESF to start work on a second undergraduate and clear my slate with a B.S. in environmental biology. I did exceptionally well that year, was noticed by a great professor, and was recruited into a master's program the following year without completing the undergrad. My research focused on interactions between lepidoptera, two of their pathogens, and the host plants on which the leps feed.

**Bottom line:** Even though I have a master's, the only undergrad degree I have is in chemistry and has limited applicability. I don't have enough entomology coursework to apply for even entry level APHIS positions. I don't have enough ecology coursework to apply for many traditional ecology jobs. My degree is going to look great framed and hanging on the wall, but I'm 34, working at Starbucks to put money in my pocket, and I'm feeling like a failure. Any advice would be appreciated!

I am, however, starting to actually think about job options and lifestyles and debating whether or not to do a PhD instead. Anyone in the environmental fields of biology with a MS or PhD, I would love to know what you think about the job options for either level of education. I also want to know about lifestyles surrounding these jobs. 

Additionally, the MS I am enrolled in is fairly general. Is it better to be in a specific or general program? With a general MS, does this bode well for work in loosely related fields (say renewable energy or water management for example)?

Does one degree offer more or less flexibility? Better or worse life/work balance? More diversity in job activities?

I have done a lot of work with city government (weed and wildlife control) as well as with consulting firms (rare plant surveys on potential oil fields) and I have not found either to be particularly fulfilling for myself. These are both important jobs, but I want to know what other kinds of options are out there, and what educational background is needed. 

Research is very appealing, but will such a field require me to be away from home constantly? Is it hard to find jobs? Do you have to live near or work for a university?

Also, I think it is incredibly hard uncover all of the job possibilities within this or related fields. Anyone within this field, what is your job? What are the responsibilities? The best and worst parts? Are you fulfilled? What education/experience led you to these jobs?

New Zealand has been praised for it successful fisheries management with its use of the Quota Management System. However, for many years now, researchers have criticized this type of management system and its short comings. Largely due to being modeled on a single species, failing to account for life history traits, relative fecundity and most importantly, fish species interactions within and between ecosystems.

Most fisheries practices are indiscriminate and end up resulting in multiple species being caught (trawlers, long-lines and purse seiners). This results in discarding of fish that are not a part of that quota or ""high-grading"" where undesirable sized fish are discarded in favor of larger fish for easier marketability.

Recently this has come under-fire again and the fisheries industry are now facing increased pressure in the light of ecologically unsustainable fishing practices, under-reporting of catch data and insufficient legislation to control it.

I thought I'd share this with those who are also in marine ecology (or interested in it) to shed light on the facade painted by our (NZ) government of the sustainability of our fishing practices. In the hopes that the more light we can shed upon the pressure we can place on a law reform to protect our precious oceans and its ecosystems. 

To give you all an example of why our legislation is terrible at protecting our fisheries and favors harvesting it, [consider our information principles on stock data;](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0088/latest/DLM395395.html?search=qs_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_fisheries+act_resel_25_h&amp;p=1)

&gt;the absence of, or any uncertainty in, any information should not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take any measure to achieve the purpose of this Act.

and the purpose of the Fisheries Act?:

&gt;The purpose of this Act is to provide for the utilisation of fisheries resources while **ensuring sustainability.**

We did an expedition to this remote island located off of Baja California last year, and documented 33 sightings over 2 weeks of survey effort, which appears to be the highest encounter rate ever reported for this species! Beaked whales are typically very difficult to study (they're extreme divers that live in deep waters and don't have a lot of surface activity, so they're challenging to observe), so Guadalupe Island appears to be an ideal place to learn more about these rare marine mammals. Beaked whales appear to be highly susceptible to human-generated noise, and mass strandings of these animals have been linked to naval sonar exercises. Thus, it is critical that we collect baseline data on the ecology and natural behaviors of these whales, so that we can better understand and mitigate their vulnerability to human disturbances.

I'm designing a hypothetical study that won't actually take place, but would like to know if I'm using the correct stats and if you think my experiment design is sound.

Experiment: What factors affect the ability of a driver to spot live dogs and avoid them

My idea was to use a driving simulation and test a how a number of variables affect the ability of a driver to avoid collisions with dogs:
1. Body colour (dark/light)
2. Body size (large/small)
3. Weather effects
4. Time of day
5. Driving speed

A person taking part in the study would experience these variables and the number of collisions would be counted for each condition. 

Im not sure how statistical analysis would work with this. Would I use an ANOVA to test for a relationship between the means of each variable? I think that would determine what factors had a significant effect on no. of collisions

I feel like the experiment needs to be simplified, but I'm struggling to see how I could do that. I would appreciate any advice/alternative insights. Thanks!",1492971942

I'm a college student studying computer science at the moment. I know that computer science has a great quantity of potential for my future, but a passion of mine for a very long time has been wildlife conservation. I want to find some sort of way to get out into the field using both my main field of study and my fight for conservation in an integrated way. I know this is a very niche issue, so it may not have very broad answers, but biometrics and climate change metrics are something I've been looking into extensively lately. If anyone has any other recommendations, please feel free to let me know!

Looks like I'll be doing some more this summer and I've got a brainstorm session in June with the man who runs it to turn some of the work into an honors project. We're both pretty open as to the direction it takes so I was just hoping to get some info from people that have used acoustic monitoring in the field.

Assuming that even 25 years down the line that oak Savannah you're restoring won't be operating on similar conditions at all, therefore might be more well suited for a different eco-types of plants, or species all together. 

I guess what I'm wondering is, should land management really be restoring to pre settlement conditions or is that going against the grain? And if we shouldn't be, what would restoring with future conditions in mind look like?

I know this is a very complex question and I don't expect concrete answers. I just thought it would be good for discussion. ",1491404167
50,ecology,Do some school of thought differentiate between biodiversity?

Now that I know that the northern hemisphere shares a lot of plant genera, and is so more homogeneous as I thought, I am wondering if there are schools of thought that use different forms of biodiversity.
In my mind it would make sense to have higher conservation value of having diversity in genera, say Alnus, Cunninghamia, Betula and Quercus in one region as opposed to having seven species of Betula in one region.

Or to use Cunninghamia again, it should have higher conservation priority as Quercus since it only contains two species whereas Quercus has 600 species.

Are there schools of thought who differentiate like this? Is it a wrong assumption? Is this ever useful in conservation or should we always go for species diversity?",1491395343

I'm looking for ideas to design an (imaginary) study that would investigate what features of roads and roadsides affect the likelihood of hedgehogs being run-over in towns and cities, assuming you have unlimited money. 

I've tried to look for previous studies investigating this for other small mammals, but I can't find anything. 

My current idea: identify hot-spots of hedgehog deaths on urban roads and try to identify common features in these environments (road linearity, speed limits etc). I think the sample size would have to be pretty big, as towns (in the UK) aren't exactly homogeneous.

What do you think? Let me know if you have a better idea!

88,ecology,Can you measure abundance or density with a transect?,"I'm doing a simple project for an intro stats class, focusing on plants. I'm primarily interested in measuring cover using a point-intercept transect method (is that the correct name? Just the nomenclature is overwhelming enough). But I would also like assess density, frequency and abundance just to give me more data to play with. 

The problem is that all the sources I have characterise those 3 parameters as something you measure with quadrats, and they are never mentioned as something you can do with transects, *but* they're never mentioned as something you *can't* do either. So what gives? I'd rather not do a visual assessment of cover and a grid won't really work with the flora i'm using, so I'm kinda stuck with transects. Frequency seems fine to me, it can just be a percentage of how many transects the species are present on, or no? 

The only reason I can think of is that it needs to be a 2D space i.e. have an area to have any meaning, but then I'm not quite sure what the mathematical reasoning would be for that. I feel like I should I know/understand all this if I want to be worth my salt as a scientist and there's something blindingly obvious that I'm missing (otherwise it would be explained in the books, right), so I apologise if this is a stupid question.

I am currently doing image processing for my software engineering project.

My project consists of using the quadrat method of sampling, then putting the quadrat through image processing where the program will check for species coverage in the quadrat. 

The program will identify how many species there are and how much space each cover in the quadrat.

My question is, right now in my testing field, I have a total of three plant species (Pandanus veitchii, Tradescantia zebrina purpusii, Gardenia jasminoides).

Each of them spanning over a 2x2M square block. 

I would like to calculate the biodiversity of this whole area, so i can use it as a base for my system to check whether it's accurate or not. 

I was going to use the simpson's diversity index but it only shows the diversity of my samples, which seems inadequate.

How should i be calculating the total biodiversity from the whole area(the 2x2M square) and how should i be calculating total biodiversity from my samples?

91,ecology,Project idea: effects of soil health on pollination resources,"Hello!
I'm interested in looking at the effects of climate change on plant-pollinator interactions, and more specifically on soil microbe-plant-pollinator community interactions. I'd love to hear your ideas on the topic, and possible routes to take. 
I'll be researching at RMBL this summer, and am considering measuring soil nutrients (denitrification rates, inorganic phosphate, soil OM, etc.--&gt;C:N:P ratios), soil moisture, and soil profiles at low, mid, and high altitudes, and correlating that data with plant functional traits (floral quality, floral quantity + size, fruit mass, fruit quantity, etc) and phenology (specifically bloom out, floral senescence, fruit out). 
Is using soil chemistry a reliable indirect measure of soil microbial activities, and is landscape topography a promising way to model climate change for this system? I am predicting an uncoupling of the redfield ratio at high vs low elevations: higher soil OM and moisture, lower denitrification rates (possibly) at high elevations, but P mineralization will likely not couple with these patterns, I'm thinking (lower temps, lower microbial metabolism).

I'm thinking of going to a school which has a really good Environmental Biology program. It's a school which is right next to this place, [rocky mountain biological lab](http://www.rmbl.org/), and I would plan to also do their undergrad research training program that they offer in the summers. 

My only issue is that I'm kind of hobbled with injuries. I have some physical damage in my hip joints, which I'm getting checked out currently. I can walk around a good deal (as I mentioned, I do walk around in nature and tough terrain a lot), but sometimes they begin to get sore and I need to take it easy for a few days, if I keep it up they can get to where they limit me a lot, but usually I can manage quite well. The other thing is I get flare ups of carpal tunnel, so sometimes if there is a large load of computer or writing work I'll end up decapacitated for a while. (I think both of these are related to an autoimmune disease I have).

So, basically, I'm inquiring here to hear some of your opinions, especially on how demanding the work can be in this field. I go from being very committed and optimistic, to sometimes hearing about how hard you'll get worked on various jobs in this field, and how it can already be spotty whether you find employment or not, and I get a sinking feeling that maybe I'm getting in over my head into something that I'll just have to give up on eventually, and with student debt to boot. 

My real aspiration with it is doing actual research. So I guess the path of going through onto the masters degree and all is what my potential path here might be. 

I don't know if I'm making a mistake here though. My other plan B option is just give up on it and go to school to be a medical imaging tech or something like that. Maybe continue with my self education on the side, and try to get involved with relevant things on the side. This feels like kind of a cop out though, as I love the scientific field so much more, and with regard to everything our planet/biosphere is going through, as well as my love of learning and of nature, I want to help somehow and be involved with the people studying these things!

So, I know no one can give me perfect advice, but if anyone has any thoughts on the matter, especially on how difficult it might be for someone in my shoes, I'd love to hear it, thanks!",1488560660

95,ecology,Feedback requested - What practical skills in your professional life do you want to learn or develop?,"What gaps in your skills and/or knowledge do you wish you had an online course for? 

I'm working as an ecologist and have come across some areas where I want to improve my own skills (i.e. soil identification, bird identification, etc). However, for some things I have had difficulty finding good resources or systems to learn the skills I need for my job at a low cost. 

It leaves me wondering if other people had the same issue and whether there is a need for some online environmental/ecology courses to develop the practical skills you need on the job. 

I'm thinking of developing an online resource because:
 
- Lower cost than traditional college courses

- Can be industry specific

- Accessible to a wider audience 

- Getting access to field courses can be a challenge for professionals 

I would love to see a platform where you could learn things and then apply them in your own work without having to take a field course. (I love field courses but they can be expensive and difficult to attend with limited budgets). 

Some of my ideas so far are: 

- GIS for forestry/environmental professionals

- Species ID - developing a system or method to learn how to ID vegetation/wildlife/birds in your area 

- How to identify soils

- Excel for forestry/environmental professionals

So my questions for you folks are:

- What would you be interested in taking an online class in? 

- Would you be willing to pay a minimal fee for an online course? 

- Do you think there is a need for this type of resource?

2,ecology,Is anybody familiar with mountain lion behavior here? Just a question on something interesting I observed out in the field.,"So, I do a lot of exploring of ecosystems around me. Today I stumbled upon a place where a mountain lion was clearly caching its kills away at. Mule deer bones where scattered around all over. A ribcage here, a leg bone there, a sacrum, a jawbone, and skulls. 

There was a pit in which several deer carcases were stored, clearly in decomposition by the smell: http://imgur.com/a/Ii1qZ

What I think clearly seems to be mountain lion scat all around: http://imgur.com/a/pPb4E

Now here's the weird thing. This cougar seems very particular about placing the bones in strange places. Bones will be laid on top of logs: http://imgur.com/a/nX9aO

On top of piles of wood:  http://imgur.com/a/NFYPp (note, these aren't that great of examples, but there did seem to be a pattern there)

And this is the weirdest. I can't get out of my head the image of the cat doing this. Or imagining why it does, but it seems like it lays the skulls out next to each other: http://imgur.com/a/0uvCd (&lt;--- this is the image that haunts me, and is the reason why I make the post).

Another place with skulls laid next to each other: http://imgur.com/a/5Mt3h (this one seems more random, but the image above clearly had a sort of intent to laying them together)

Seems like the cat likes to toy with the remnants of its prey. Very interesting behavior. Has anyone ever seen or heard of anything like this before?

 1. The 10% law, i.e. the trophic efficiency is always 10%
 2. The trophic efficiency increases with trophic level (which was substantiated by data).

I recently graduated with an MSc in biology focussing on animal behaviour and adaptation that was quite research orientented and I'm now looking at switching to a more industry/government sort of job since I decided a life of writing grants and scrambling for post-doc positions wasn't for me. In short, I've fallen out of love with the reality of academia, but I still love biology.

However, finding a job in industry has been a challenge so far since I don't really have any formal experience with things like environmental assessments or water quality and things like that.

""Most dominant species have widespread distributions, but in many ecoregions there can be a large number of ecoregional and local endemics; beta diversity can be high for plants, invertebrates, and some smaller vertebrates in some ecoregions; unusual soils can harbor many specialist plants and invertebrates; some ecoregions can have very high alpha and gamma diversity for plants, particularly understory species and herbaceous floras.""

Now, I'm familiar with biodiversity theory, but I am new to these higher level delineations. I've tried to find further sources as to why plants specifically in TDF might have high beta diversity, as well as invertebrates and small vertebrates (why not large vertebrates? What is the significance of size in relation to diversity here?). I'm just generally unfamiliar with the term. I understand that beta diversity is a form of differentiation diversity and is the difference in communities along a gradient in a landscape, but I would appreciate if someone could extrapolate for TDF specifically. The same applies to alpha and gamma diversity. Am I right in saying that for alpha diversity, this could be influenced by management such as coppicing, if alpha diversity is simply a form of inventory diversity in a sample of a community? I suppose it makes sense that the herbaceous layer of forests will have much higher alpha diversity than, say, desert. 

Much appreciated.

I really want to take classes that will be useful for finding work, either academic or not. My options are Ecosystem Ecology and Population Genetics. Both are upper division undergraduate level. The Ecosystem Ecology class is taught by someone who does ecological restoration and the Population Genetics class is taught by someone who does research in the topic.

So, my real question is which course would be more useful for skill purposes and/or which would you take and why? Do you use a certain one of those mentioned in your daily life or do you wish you had take one?

I'm a student at Washington University in St. Louis and I'm doing a small project on how different subcultures view nature/the environment, so I'm asking users of different subreddits their opinions on nature. Any and all answers to these questions are appreciated, so, if you choose to respond, you're free to do so however you want. Of course, I won't include any of your personal information in the project; only your answers will be reported. If you're interested in receiving a final copy of the project report, send me a private message.

Thanks so much!

Here are the questions: How do you define nature? How would you describe your relationship with the environment?

(Also, I apologize if this violates any rules. I did read them, and I didn't see anything that I thought this would violate, but I'm not sure if this counts as being directly related to ecology. I'm hoping it will spark some discussion on how your relationship with ecology relates to nature!)",1480643443

21,ecology,"Confused about the function of ecosystems, looking for quite some answers and information in general","Popular or folk ecology ‚Äì if I may call it that - talks of ecosystems as stable entities perfectly in balance. When I came across articles that this might not be true, I started a journey of self-study. I found that indeed the idea of stable entities perfectly in balance is simply not true. I came to this conclusion by reading about ecology, paleoecology and biogeography. However I think I went too far by thinking that ecosystems do not have any kind of equilibrium at all, and that I fell for confirmation bias by looking too much at that which supported the idea that this premise of balanced ecosystems isn‚Äôt true.

While I find it hard to grasp if we can talk of ecosystems being better (in function, partly because it is a value-judgement), however there are clearly factors and roles within ecosystems that make certain species richness in the ecosystem possible. One of which I was aware of was co-evolution. I had some skeptism about the role of large herbivores and predators, but after that self-study I started to formally study ecology, that skeptism became much less. My skeptism was whatever they were really necessary, but I concluded that at least for current biodiversity, large predators and herbivores are a necessary component. But I am a bit confused because these herbivores and predators, as well as the plants, might have more or less randomly formed an ecosystem (due to climate and movement, or due to extinction). Surely co-evolution might have played a role, but it cannot have been responsible for the becoming of the whole functioning ecosystem. Is that correct? All we can know is that this original ecosystem supported those species. But where do we draw the line for this original state?

That brings me to my next question. Since there has been so much anthropogenic change, is it fair to think of those (as) original ecosystems? I ask this because it seems that certain species have increased in numbers (say crows) and others have decreased, which I am assuming to affect the ecosystem as a whole and species in particular. Just an example: high populations of herbivores seem to have negative effects on plants. Ecological restoration seems to focus on these original ecosystems, and seemingly concludes that if all the species are present it functions like the original system, while my reasoning goes that they are likely to function (slightly) differently, because the parts of the ecosystem have changed (species richness). Could I be correct here, does species richness matter or are the species in the ecosystem all that matters for it to be the original ecosystem? Coming back to this later.

Another confusion is about some non-native species. What I can understand is co-evolution. Local plants do co-evolve with local insects, so unless the non-native plant is similar in chemical, morphological and so on composistion or ‚Äì simpler - of the same family of native species, the non-native species will have low ecological value due to lack of co-evolution and thus adaptation of local insects. There are other specific cases of non-native species completely changing ecoystems, which is fair to call negative, due to co-evolution. I‚Äôll name a few: cane toads and Australian carnivores (no co-evolution with poisonous toads), earthworms and North-American forests (though this one is confusing because futher south earthworms do exist) and Australian plants and hoofed herbivores (hoofes being evolutionary new as well as the impact they have on the soil). From these cases I understand that the abscence of something in evolutionary history suddenly becoming introduced often means a negative impact on the local species, which also applies to islands in particular. 

But there are species in which this does not seem to be the case, while similar arguments are used. Consider the nutria. The problem with nutria seem to be its grazing, but could we really point to co-evolution in this case? Isn‚Äôt it more a problem of population such as with the native herbivores? In which I case I would point to predation as the missing factor that limits the grazing. Grazing which I learned creates microhabitats and thus if not done excessively makes more diversity possible. I think similar about the sacred ibis in Europe. It was supposed to negatively impact breeding birds, but in that case what makes the predation evolutionary distinct from, say, crows? I think there still can be valid reasons about the negativity of these species due to competition (in case of the sacred ibis, you could point out that is an additional predation). And with this I want to get back to one of my earlier questions. Because, wouldn‚Äôt an increase in certain native species also increase competition with other species, thus changing the original ecosystem?

Another question: have there been any general rules derived from the function of ecosystem? All I know is that biodiversity tends to breed more biodiversity. And from what I now wrote I would speculate that disturbance creating microclimates tends to increase biodiversity as long as it is limited and local, while excessive disturbance lowers biodiversity (which really is just spatial diversity creates biodiversity).

Yet another question: I have become interested in complex systems, and I have only started discovering it, but I am wondering if there has been any crosspollination between the field of complex systems and ecology. I think I found but one book on this subject.

I suppose my questions could already be answered in a textbook, so far I only had courses and am still waiting for ""essentials of ecology"". But I do hope my questions can be answered, if only by suggesting books to read.

I did this N, S, E, &amp; W of the central waypoint to account for the 10 m error radius in the satellite tracker attached to the manatee. For each of the locations, the percent cover for each species was averaged. I have 26 locations in which the manatee visited and 22 locations that the manatee did not go to. My data are not normal, and I have a significant number of zeros. I used a Spearman's rank correlation test in SPSS to find correlation between visit and several other factors. Are there any other nonparametric tests I could use? Or is there some kind of transformation that is used with percent cover data or data with many zeros? Any ideas would be helpful.

25,ecology,Plant Pigment Chromatography Questions,"Hello, all. I'll try to keep this brief. I'm writing a report based on a chromatography experiment we carried out for our science unit on a BSc in Ecology and Conservation Management (year 1)

This paragraph highlights what was found:

Firstly, it can be seen that a range of pigments exist within the examined Q. robur leaves. Œ≤-Carotene travelled the farthest with an Rf of 1.00 whilst chl-b travelled the least with an Rf of 0.14. Chl-a resides in the middle with an Rf of 0.27. The greater Œ≤-Carotene Rf value indicate that the pigment molecules have less of an affinity for the hydrophilic paper, are more soluble in the hydrophobic solvent and are less massive, whereas the smaller value for chl-b indicates the inverse. In regard to the unidentified red leaf an Rf of 0.33 was produced for chl-a and 0.14 for chl-b, values very similar to those found in the oak extract for the same pigments. Overall, the results consistently track the polarity of the pigment molecules from more polar chl-b to the intermediate chl-a through to the nonpolar hydrocarbon, Œ≤-Carotene. 

Just in case you're wondering we used petroleum ether/acetone as our solvent at 9:1.

Questions. Why does the red leaf (we couldn't i.d it) not contain any form of carotenoid or why was it not drawn out? From my understanding, all plants should have carotenoids. What is the significance of the chl-a and chl-b Rf values being very similar to each other for both leaf extracts? I suppose it's because Rf values are constant in one particular solvent? For some reason I'm struggling to write the discussion and pull out key points other than saying that a greater amount of pigment types in a plant will maximize light absorbance. My main question is why we couldn't find any carotenoids at all in the red leaf.  It doesn't make sense because our origin point dot was red to begin with and the leaf itself was red so how we got just chlorophyll a and b I have no idea.

3,ecology,Pathway for a career in Forest Ecology?,"Hello! I am a 25-year old girl finally in a financial position to go to college. I've been considering a career in forestry, but I am also interested in pursuing a more scientific aspect of that career by going to graduate school after undergrad. I can really only afford to go to school in-state and the university here does not have an actual Ecology program - only a minor in Conservation Ecology is offered. I was wondering if it makes sense to major in Forestry and tack on the Conservation Ecology minor and still be eligible to pursue Forest Ecology in grad school - or is it preferred that I major in an actual hard science such as Bio/Chem/Geology? 

I took a look at the Forestry program course list and it requires quite a few science classes (2 biology, 1 chem, 1 dendrology, 2 ecology) and if I tack on the Ecology minor I would have a few more science classes under my belt as well. My only concern is that it may not be enough? I searched some prerequisites for Ecology grad school and haven't been able to dig up much. I'd rather not major in Biology because I want to focus more on forests, and if I can get away with not doing it I'd like to.

9,ecology,How did you get into grad school??Advice?,"Hey there peeps, I basically need some advice about applying to grad school. I graduated in ecology in 2015 (Canada), and since I have gotten two seasonal intro technician positions in the aquatic/fisheries field, but want to go further. My goal is to get into a grad school program, hopefully by next fall, but my problem is that: #1 I don't really have strong academic references (didnt interact much with professors during my undergrad, was a fool and didnt try to get internships/volunteer in research labs. Took a field course with independent research project but don't know if that has much vallue?). I have work references, but dont know if they have much value cuz the positions were support/technical (data collections, but no like analyzing). #2 I don't really know a specific topic I want to do research on (though I think I'd want to work on aquatic/marine fish populations, community dynamics, habitat use..). My plan in the upcoming year is to get some sort of research intenrship/volunteer experience and start a certificate on fisheries management, in hopes that will give me academic references that could vouch for me when applying to a masters program and help me decide on a research question/area.

My questions are: how did you guys get into graduate school? Do you have any advice on how to succeed at applying? Do internships (and who you do them with, aka. University labs vs organizations like the Smithsonian) actually help?

19,ecology,PROYECTO: Cercas hechas de PET,"OBJETIVO

Los ni√±os hoy en d√≠a est√°n muy sublevados, corren y juegan sin preocuparse por el bienestar de las plantas del colegio. El objetivo de este proyecto ecol√≥gico es crear cercas para las plantas que circundan el √°rbol encontrado afuera del taller de tecnolog√≠a, a fin de evitar el reiterado pisoteo de ni√±os peque√±os.

MATERIALES

* Una barra de madera con dimensiones 15 de largo, 4 de ancho y 4 de alto.

* 2 Palitos de helado.

* 1 Hoja de cuchillo Cartonero.

* Huincha hiladora.

* Caladora.

* Botella de pl√°stico PET.

* 3 gotas de mucho amor y esfuerzo.

* Estacas.

* L√°piz mina.

* Regla.

PLAN DE ACCI√ìN DEL PROYECTO

Para comenzar es necesario fabricar la herramienta hiladora de pl√°stico. Se toma el trozo de madera y en √©ste se marcar√° con el l√°piz dos secciones, perpendiculares al largo, a 4,5 y 5,5 cm del borde. Se realizar√°n dos cortes con la caladora, uno de ellos por el centro a lo largo y el otro transversal a modo de que queden en forma de X. Al terminar de cortar se coloca la hoja de cuchillo cartonero dentro de la hendidura que va a lo ancho. Para sujetar esta hoja y que no se caiga se colocan los palitos de helado para tapar la abertura y se fijan con la huincha hiladora. Ahora tenemos nuestra herramienta lista. Luego se proceder√° a cortar el asiento de la botella y luego una peque√±a tira en la parte inferior de la botella a modo de otorgarnos un inicio para el hilo de botella. Se coloca la botella por la hendidura que se encuentra a lo largo del trozo de madera y se coloca la tira que hab√≠amos hecho por detr√°s de la hoja. S√≥lo queda tirar de la tira y la botella comenzar√° a girar mientras la hoja corta a √©sta.

Tras conseguir el hilo de botella se trenzar√°n hilos de botella para aumentar la resistencia. Luego se proceder√° a la realizaci√≥n de la cerca. Para esto se enterrar√°n las estacas en la tierra de forma paralela alrededor del jard√≠n del √°rbol ubicado frente al taller de tecnolog√≠a. Tras esto se comenzar√° a tejer los hilos de botella entre las estacas, a fin de producir la deseada cerca y finalmente proteger a las plantas de las constantes pisadas de los ni√±os que rondan la zona.

IMPACTO MEDIOAMBIENTAL

Desde el milenio pasado la sociedad acarrea numerosos problemas, siendo probablemente el m√°s ignorado el medioambiental. Debido a la mentalidad global, las empresas constantemente est√°n buscando el mayor beneficio posible en el √°mbito econ√≥mico, lo cual conlleva el descuido de los desechos. Numerosas pr√°cticas son utilizadas para poder contaminar con mayor facilidad, siendo la deslocalizaci√≥n una de las m√°s comunes (Mover el lugar de empresas para conseguir una legislaci√≥n menos rigurosa en √°mbitos ecol√≥gicos). Uno de los contaminantes m√°s comunes son los pl√°sticos de las botellas, sobre todo las desechables, encontr√°ndose generalmente el piso. Es por esto que el proyecto buscar√° reutilizar este material

que suele estar en mal uso. Centr√°ndonos en nuestro caso m√°s cercano, el establecimiento escolar tambi√©n se ve afectado por este problema, con botellas tiradas en el piso, dejadas sobre la mesa y simplemente en la basura. Al realizar el proyecto no solo se les da una nueva vida √∫til a las botellas sino que adem√°s se conseguir√° proteger una de las pocas zonas verdes del colegio.

DIFUSI√ìN DEL PROYECTO

Para conseguir una mayor difusi√≥n del proyecto, se utilizar√°n diversos medios, los cuales incluyen grupos en servicios de mensajer√≠as, como es el caso de Whatsapp publicaciones en redes sociales como Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Reddit, Tinder e incluso en sitios de descargas como Mega. Adem√°s ser√° difundido de manera social en conversaciones interpersonales y afiches visuales.

I have a kitten I adopted who was found in the parking lot that loves to play hunt with random objects in the house... She will set up a ball, for example, and attack it from different acrobatically-inclined angles and I feel so bad because I know it's something she misses doing in the wild. 

So I was wondering, since my housemates and I grow a bunch of different types of herbs and veggies in the house, if there would be any insects that would benefit our yield's source of nutrition that will eventually grow into insects, breed, and venture off to be eaten by our cats. 

It would be beneficial to their health in so many ways... Especially since the older cat is overweight. They'd also stop play fighting so much. They can get real mad at each other if one gets too rough... 

So yeah, I figured I could use the help of you guys to help me brainstorm some great ideas for creating this environment. :)

I'm curious because I was wondering about how historic humans (probably likely definitely) have used hunting, poison or other methods as a means to limit populations of animals that predated on us (tigers, lions, bears, wolves, crocodiles and so on). 

I was wondering if there were/are parallels to this seen in other species? 

We know that the inverse happens- predators do hunt their prey into extinction (cases of invasive species of wild rats absolutely butchering native populations, amongst others) but do we know of other/similar cases where prey species hunted or otherwise killed their predators into obscurity? 

Or if hunting/killing their predators into submission does not exist, does there exist other cases of prey actively taking down their natural predators in general? 

Key word here is actively, not as in response to a threat but deliberately going out of their way to suppress their predatory species.

Anyways, long story short, Opie is a great cat. He's affectionate, adventurous, and best of all unlike the cat my sister had that wandered off in search of greener pastures Opie knows exactly where his litter box and food dish are. So I like to let the little bugger outside for the most part whenever he asks, he rarely stays out for more than a couple hours and never strays far from our yard. Lately though I keep seeing this skunk under our camper when I come home from work, so I've been keeping poor Opie inside at nights and he hates me for it. I can picture him trying to play with it, only to startle the skunk and end up being sprayed, he can be pretty rambunctious.

I've had a few different jobs, mostly seasonal, and now know that I love field work as opposed to lab work and am trying to make the transition into full time wildlife/marine/zoology/conservation/ecology or something along those lines. Anything that puts me outside working with nature. A ton of the positions I've seen and applied for (especially government jobs) seem to lean heavily on GIS knowledge and experience, of which I have absolutely none. 

Does anyone have experience with the [GIS specialization offered on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gis) (through UC Davis)? I've taken a lot of Coursera courses before, mostly for fun, and have one certificate in forensics. Would something like this actually contribute much to my applications? It's a good bit of money to throw down ($355 for the full specialization), but I'm willing to do it if it would really be beneficial, as I'm currently unemployed and need something to do anyway. Coursera does also offer financial aid, which I'll probably apply for, but I have no idea how that works or likely it is for it to be waived. 

I love Coursera as far as courses to take for fun, but how much are those certificates respected in the real world? Do they actually mean anything to add to a resume or is it just a novelty? Does this specialization cover what I'd need to know to use GIS in biology (I literally know nothing about it)? Are there any other online GIS course options that would be a better bet?

I know ultimately experience is what counts in this field moreso than education, but this seems like a possible exception since so many jobs want the knowledge in GIS and I can't find a starting point to get any.

I am now at a point where I transition to the next stage of my career and for some time now I've been contemplating ecology job options that are heavily GIS dependent (conservation planning, landscape ecology, disaster modeling etc).

I've come to realize that I really enjoy spatial analyses (and working with GIS in general) and would want to further my skill set in this regard. However I have no formal training in GIS or related courses (I think I could benefit from one) and have only very basic understanding of it.

I'd really appreciate some inputs and suggestions in this regard. Specifically -

1. Does an MS after a PhD make sense?
2. If so, would a 2 year MS be better than a 1 year one?
3. Besides pursuing the Master's path, are there any other options that I could possibly explore?
4. Any recommendations for particularly relevant schools/universities/ programmes?

Thank you!

82,ecology,Clarifying what 'mechanism' means in Ecology.,"Hey all. I am beginning research into the practice of ecologists surrounding their explanations of phenomena using the notion of mechanisms (ex./ mechanisms of extinction, or seed dispersal). More specifically, has the philosophy of mechanisms in the philosophical literature captured mechanisms well enough as to allow it to be applied to ecological practice, or should we think of so-called ecological mechanisms differently? 

I have been reading through some ecological papers and am finding that the term mechanism is used a lot, and in different ways. The word 'mechanism' itself seems to be interchangeable with 'cause' sometimes, for instance, however, other times there seems to be more meat behind what is meant by mechanism -  there's a more complex picture.

What I would really like to know is: does anyone know of any sources where ecological mechanisms themselves are discussed, and not specific examples of ecological mechanisms - the latter seems easy to find, and will no doubt be useful. In other words, is there literature of ecologists talking about the notion of ecological mechanisms that anyone knows about?

Any further thoughts about this topic would also be welcomed - especially if I seem not to have the right idea at the get go. I am trained in philosophy and not ecology, so any insight would go much appreciated.

92,ecology,"As a sort of citizen science passion project I documented the animals and plants within a riparian ecosystem for close to a year. If there is any interest, I can post some of my findings here.","It's a bit of an interesting situation as this is a tiny stretch of riparian ecosystem, just about a mile long, which is situated between a dam/large reservoir and my small city.    

Despite being such an ""island"", it is quite biodiverse. So far I've observed there:

* Mule deer.    
* Beavers.        
* A site where a mountain lion presumably kills and stores deer carcasses.    
* Different Hawk species. 
* Quite a sizeable colony of double crested cormorants.    
* Several Great Blue Heron families which make their heronry alongside the cormorants.       
* Canada Geese.      
* Different duck species.
* Kingfishers.        
* Great Horned Owls.       
* At least 2 breeding pairs of Osprey.   
* A flock of Wild Turkey which roam the river valley canyon walls.     
* Magpies.   
* Turkey Vultures.     
* Western Grebes.       
* Migratory Bald Eagles.   
* Mississippi Kites.              
* Assortments of smaller birds.          
* Gray Fox.         
* Coyote.   
* Raccoon.    
* Ground Squirrels.                  
* Rabbit species.        

I've also recorded most plants that I've come across, and at different times of year too. And also I've captured a sliver of the entomological population as well.     
 
I've caught a slight bit of some of these animals hunting strategies, some of their interactions, and got bits and pieces of them raising their young, especially the Osprey, Cormorants, and Herons.   

Basically just an overlook of this little ecosystem as I've observed it so far. I think it is a pretty interesting little case study of an ecosystem that is clearly fractured (existing in a small space between Dam and city), and yet still harboring a lot of diversity. I've also captured a little bit of how the road that runs through the river valley impacts animals (have found dead beaver, turkey, and deer alongside that road so far).      

I've got all my photo and video on a hard drive currently, and am looking to organize it all somewhere. So I figure maybe I could share some key parts on here if anyone is interested.

28,ecology,"Rescaling ecological ODEs: is there a good tutorial, or strategy to follow?","Hi fellow ecologists,

I've been digging deeper into modeling the past couple of years, and have started to notice a common practice, which I could use some assistance with.  

In many papers, often those using coupled systems of ODES (e.g. lotka-volterra, simple metapopulations, etc.), the authors rescale their variables to simplify analyses.

For instance, if I understand correctly, the logistic model can be rescaled from this:

    dn/dt = r N (1 - N / K) 

to this:

    dn / dt = N ( 1 - N)

In this second equation, N can only vary between 0 and 1, implying 1 is the new K and that N is a proportion of this, i.e. N = N / K.  

I believe somehow the r then gets incorporated into time, but I don't fully understand how.  

A more complex example of rescaling is done in the linked paper ""Selective Sweeps in Growing Microbial Colonies,"" which uses generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. 

https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4896

In this, the growth rate parameters don't go away, but the competition parameters are rescaled.

It is unclear to me exactly why this rescaling made things ""easier.""  In the first case, I get it, because r and K are now gone so the effects of those parameters are not something to worry about. But what is easier here?

It is also unclear to me how to ""see"" what rescaling could be useful.

Any tips / links / thoughts on the process would be very useful!

There's a lake design that I'm working on, which will be built on private property. The owner saw how one of his family members dug out his own lake and practically threw all the fish he wanted in. He just left it like that, hoping it would take off and be a good place to get food. Now it has a chronic algae problem, oversized invasive fish, and for many years the bass population was small and the blue gill had a hard time keeping up. I imagine this was due to an imbalance in the strata in the food web; there weren't any producers and forage fish.

Cue my position here building a food web based upon the ideal fish that are wanted in the lake. I drew up a rough draft, but like most people who aren't directly involved in the DNR or a similar department, my model is guesswork based upon internet research and personal experience studying each organism individually and not in an environment. I tried this link to run models:

https://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/interactives/ecology/ecology.html?initLesson=1

But it's overly simplified, not accounting for reproduction rates. Some of the species I would introduce specifically have a low reproduction rate so they don't overtake the microenvironment, while others should explode in number because they work that way i.e. plankton.

Does anyone have a suggested internet program or other model they use either idly or in academia? I don't want to plan one thing and turns out in a year I end up making the same mistakes as someone that doesn't think to check.

Not sure if this is the right Subreddit to ask this, but here goes.

I'm an undergraduate studying biology, and I've been applying for co-op jobs. I recently got a job offer as a Lab Research Assistant with Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada, but after thinking about it a bit, I'm not sure if it will be worth taking this job. The job basically entails assisting cattle feed/crop nutritional analysis; assessing cattle greenhouse gas/ammonia emissions; blood, urine, feces analysis for metabolites and metabolism analysis; in vitro fermentation and in situ analysis of cattle digestibility, etc.

At the moment, I plan on going into something along the lines of Ecology/Wildlife Biology, so I'm not too sure whether or not biochemical lab work will be too relevant or useful when compared to things like GIS or Stats (I applied thinking that real-life lab experience for me might be good, along with possible transferable knowledge about animal nutrition, but I never really looked into it and one thing led to another). The other thing is that this job requires me to move to a small city in Alberta, and it will be the first time I will be living on my own, making the decision of taking a job that I'm not too thrilled about even more difficult.

Sorry that this is a bit of a loaded and unfocused question, but based by what the job entails and my future goals, I wanted to get some opinions from those in Ecology or related disciplines on whether or not this job will be worth it.

61,ecology,A future career in Ecology?,"Hi all,

I'm an M.S. candidate at a U.S. university. I'm specializing in insect-plant interactions, and insect behavior (hopefully). I'm curious about future job opportunities in the states as a non-citizen. I'm an international student and I understand the need for a company to sponsor a work visa for me if I hope to work in the US. At the same time I realize I can't work for any state or federal government agency...so that takes a chunk out of potential employers for me. I'm wondering what other possibilities are there for me? Are there private companies that specialize in my sort of focuses? 

Academia has always been another path for me. However, I feel like I need another year of graduate school to really see if I want to continue this lifestyle. 

Any help would be appreciated!",1470772054

I'm coming to near the end of my Master's and have been applying for the few jobs around me at present (Hampshire, UK). I know there's a lot to take into account when applying for jobs, and subsequently being rejected, and that I'll probably be at it for a long time until I do find something, but I was curious as to what type of level job people would/have/think is right to look at post-Master's.  

I've basically written off anything voluntary, a) because I need to be paid, and b) because I don't want to be volunteering after spending so much money to get a Master's and basically don't want to be doing something so entry level that I'd not be getting paid for it (even if this is possibly the wrong view point).  

I've got a small amount of research experience as a voluntary research assistant from back during my undergrad, no published papers or anything though, but basically I was curious about what sort of level job people would expect someone with a Master's to aim for. Whether you're someone that would be hiring, or someone that has been hired off a Master's etc.  

Been looking at various jobs, e.g. governmental ""marine adviser"", ecologist (of which *all* ecologist jobs seem to want membership to an ecology organisation and various animal licenses, not to mention the experience ""required""). I haven't seen any research assistant positions come up in my area yet, and while in the long-term I definitely would consider other areas, immediately post-master's I'll be pretty desperate for money so am looking locally for now.  

Any thoughts, advice, stories of your own?  

(P.S. My degree and Master's are(/will) both in marine biology, but I am a) looking at ecology jobs in general and b) very interested in ecology overall)",1468927814

74,ecology,[Discussion] Ethics of Ecological Field Experiments,"In the 1960s, the recently deceased Robert Paine conducted several experiments on the shores of Washington. He would remove star fish from a specified area and observe how the ecosystem of that area would change overtime. What he found was an incredible loss of biodiversity. Without the starfish to keep them at bay, mussels moved in and dominated the experimental area. This would lead to the ecological concept of the keystone species, where a single species' absence can change the dynamics of an entire ecosystem. It has clear implications for conservation policy.  

Not only did these experiments introduce the concept of the keystone species, but they also introduced the concept of experimental field biology/ecology, where researchers manipulate specific variables in the wild. Since then, experimental field ecology has become a stable in modern research. 

My question (and what I'd like to put up for discussion) is whether such experiments are ethical. The intentional manipulation of the natural environment has the potential to be unethical, given that the consequences are unknown. An entire ecosystem could be destroyed as a result of the experiment. I can imagine some utilitarian framework that puts scientific knowledge over the individual survival of an ecosystem if that knowledge can save many more ecosystems, but this seems to contradict the ""leave no traces"" mentality that many conservationists/naturalists like Aldo Leopold upheld. Even more, there's no guarantee that any information of large importance will come out of the experiment. 

Is there an inherent tension between experimental field ecology and the conservationist ethic? How are field experiments regulated to ensure that they do not inflict permanent damage of the local environment? 


Full disclaimer: I'm not an ecologist nor am I a philosopher, just an amateur reader of both fields. 

I'd also like to add that my goal here is not to discredit or ruin Paine's legacy, but to discuss a trend in the field of ecology. ",1466034210

I'm not sure if any of y'all have expertise in this field but I am trying to model a population of organisms using a Jolly-Seber approach.

My problem seems to be that I am getting ""apparent probability of survival estimates"" for certain sampling periods that are much &gt; 1. Obviously, this can't be the case because an individual can't have a survival probability greater than 1. 

Some considerations. This population could be viewed as a single large population (only about 3-4 square km total. However, I am unable to sample throughout the entire habitat each sampling event. I was thinking it might be more likely to break the entire habitat into several smaller habitat parcels and look at them individually. The problem with this is that if there is movement of individuals I would have a marked individual that would be previously undetected at any sampling point in a given habitat, and Jolly-Seber requires capture history of each individual.

On the other hand, if I were to take this as one large population. I am unable to uniformly sample across the entire habitat each trip, so the data would be skewed. Since I am unable to sample entire habitat each trip.

Could it be that large seasonal population growth rates might inflate my ""apparent probability of survival"" in J-S type models? Any ideas of a more suitable model to use in populations that are vary largely from season to season?",1465244092

I received a diploma from a technical college for environmental science a few weeks ago and I quickly got hired on by a watershed/wildlife group.  Since my studies did not dive deeply into ecology/conservation, I am definitely feeling out of my wheel house when it comes to the fish species of Atlantic Canada, watershed management practices, insect and bird IDs, and general ecology.  Do you guys have any advice or some free/cheap resources for me to utilize? 

I definitely think this will be a great experience for me, as there are some tasks I have been assigned that are directly linked to my chosen field.  This will more than likely be a position I fill in for the summer as I am going to university for resource management in the fall.

22,ecology,Making a Difference through Ecology,"I recently began a PhD program in ecology and while I am excited about my research, I also have the overwhelming feeling that, if what I truly want is to contribute to promoting an ecologically sustainable planet, then I chose the wrong path. I love ecology, but has the academic world actually resulted in an increase in conservation and preservation? Because it feels as though we have regressed over the last decade or so and that many of the most important pieces of legislation that resulted in actual conservation action (ESA, CAA etc.) occurred decades ago and primarily at the urging of novelists, citizens and forward thinking politicians. Today, I believe, such legislation would never have passed due to the current political climate, the general mistrust of scientists/environmentalists by the general public and a lack of support. 

I guess my question is a bit existential and perhaps too heavy for this subreddit, but in general, how does/can academia contribute to addressing real-life environmental crises? The idea of spending 5 years of my life working on a project that will be published in an obscure scientific journal horrifies me and is leaving in a bit of a pit of despair. Hell, even publishing in a mainstream journal like Nature or Science, while obviously excellent for one's career, is unlikely to produce any real-world applications or changes. I guess I am just feeling overall, that pursuing an academic career seems to be more about self-promotion and accolades and less about addressing the very real and urgent problems facing the planet.

37,ecology,In need of an ID-key for predator hair samples under magnification.,"I'm currently set to start my Master's research with the University of Alberta on a small prairie in the mountains just northeast of Banff National Park's uppermost border. Members from my lab have previously collected approximately 60-70 hair samples from the kill sites of elk and are hoping to incorporate these data into an ongoing study of predation in the area.

If anyone has a key for identifying predator hairs under a microscope, it would be much appreciated. Any key for cougar, wolf, grizzly, black bear, lynx, or coyote hair would be immensely helpful (even if the key doesn't contain all those species).

If getting this key would require a bit of effort on your behalf (i.e. emailing a few colleagues for access, digging into old files), I am happy to pay you $40 for the favour. (The use of these hair samples isn't exactly a priority, so the lab hasn't put up any money to find an ID-key. This is just a personal effort to be resourceful and provide value to my new co-workers). ",1460392101

And I am wondering if this might be a good forum to learn more about a question I've been pondering. After reading an article, perhaps not a very scientific one but nevertheless, about an expected dip in the population of ticks the coming year because of the cold Norwegian winter (I don‚Äôt even know if this is true?), I started thinking about the rest of our fauna and flora. What about the other plants and animals? What happens when the you exceed the normal variations in temperature, and how much could the Norwegian fauna take before we‚Äôd see significant changes or extinction of plants and/or animals? Crops for instance are very vulnerable to changes in weather. What do we know about this? Are there significant observations related to this problem other places in the world as a consequence of climate changes or abnormal variations in temperature? In Siberia the temperature can be as low as -70 C - would we lose species by say experiencing -70 for 2 days several years in a row near the arctic circle in Norway, where I‚Äôd say a normal variation might go as low as -15 C? And please, leave references to your sources of information, since I am quite the nerd :)",1460106806

Some time ago I was first introduced to the lost flora of Europe in a book, it said Europa lost many of its flora because of the ice age(s). Another ecology book from college mentioned that Europe's flora was much more diverse; similar to current China and North-America. I've also come across sites that mention that some non-native flora used to be native during preglacial times, such as rhododendron (Rhododendron ponticum) and 
turkey oak (Quercus cerris) in the UK. Carya (hickory), Liquidambar (sweetgum) and Sequoiadendron (giant redwood) are genera that went extinct in Europe (according to the two books). Another book I found at Google books mentioned a high percentage of flora that went exctinct in Europe, something between 70 or 90 percent because of the ice age(s) - if I remember correctly(!). Can't find this (google)book anymore.

Today I found a link that speaks a bit about pre-glacial vegetation, but more of North-America. It is creationist, and talks pseudoscience about the biblical flood, but I assume that it is correct about the trees. Here it is:

http://www.dragontrees.com/tertiary.html

Since I find only find small pieces on this subject I was wondering if somebody knows a good and more detailed source on Europe's preglacial vegetation. I shall note that I am only really interested in trees and shrubs. 

I hope this is the right place to ask, I was thinking of r/askscience but I don't think they would allow this. I am also a bit confused, as one might see, if it was one or more ice ages that were the cause of the loss and if the blame can be solely pointed to climatic change. 

The ecology book I mentioned earlier, states that the higher extinction rates of Europe compared to North-America and Asia (China) are caused by a lack of surface area in Europe. An earlier hypothesis was that the east-west orientation of the mountain chains caused the higher diversity loss, but according to the ecology book this is deemed less important (the other, first, book I read gave only this explanation)

I hope that somebody can help me, thanks in advance. If this isn't a good place to ask this, please direct me to a right one.",1455900838

So I'm struggling a bit being a new englander involved in the local herp society and being surrounded by people who think this is a great idea. Don't get me wrong, I fear for these snakes as they're already endangered in our area. But the way they're going about it has me questioning a few things that seem like very large barriers. I feel like they're ignoring a lot of factors, but I may just not understand how they're overcome? Few of my concerns:

- food source, claim there's a healthy population of chipmunks ect but ya know..haven't added the predator in yet which could change that. 

-genetic diversity, I've heard numbers anywhere from 100-150 snakes being released. But..ok now you have 100snakes on an island just breeding. With such a small population sample wouldn't it pontetially promote a weakness in the growing population? Especially if the place is so safe and perfect for them. What mutations may form on the island population that could be more harm then good?

-""they can swim off"" well that's great, and I'm sure when they run out of food they may just do that, but after a few inbred generations how fit will they really be?

-were never naturally occurring on that island or really even in that particular area it seems. Which to me must be for a natural reason. 

Again, I'm still finishing my degree so I may be missing something, for now I've been trying to dodge the subject as to avoid the heated conversation with people in the hobby of keeping reptiles as pets in my local area who want to talk about this. I'd just like some feedback and to hear the opinions of others in this career field who may have more knowledge or experience. Thanks!

Edit: I'm sorry I just realized I wasn't very clear about my concern. I know our rattlers don't bother anyone(hell barely any left). I'm concerned the government is going to sink money into funding this project that will only create a weaken population in a location they aren't found naturally who will either die out, or drain the segregated ecosystem of the island then swim off the island and be killed by the people who live along the shore. I would much rather they put the money into a reserve near a location they can more readily find wild rattlers as well and grow the population in a more natural environment. So not concerned about the snakes beyond this project just being unable to maintain and in the end fail. ",1454544172

55,ecology,Seeking feedback on the direction /r/ecology should head towards,"The mods have been discussing the direction that /r/ecology should head towards going into the future. Right now, we have two basic rules: 1) that the post should at least tangentially related to ecological sciences and; 2) that the post is predominantly in English. The first rule cuts down on posts that could easily be accepted in a multitude of other subreddits, by far the most common being posts related to improving your eco-friendliness, carbon footprint, or to permaculture and the like since there are a plethora of more relevant subreddits out there for this sort of content including: /r/environment, /r/permaculture, /r/organicfarming, etc. A lot of these subreddits are listed in our list of [related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/wiki/subreddits) (also in the sidebar). The second rule actually cuts down on a lot of these posts as well that would be more appropriate elsewhere. It also allows the mods to more accurately judge the quality of the content.

When I first starting modding this subreddit 4.5 years ago, I relatively strictly enforced the rule that it had to relate specifically to ecological sciences. In the last few years, we've been more lenient on tangentially related posts but I still remove a fair amount of posts related to other topics described above. There is not really a strict guideline that we follow and we've never asked for what the community thinks about this, until now.

So, the mods are interested in feedback on what should and should not be allowed in this sub. Things we are specifically interested in:

* We are entertaining the idea of **banning direct links to just images and/or videos**, as these rarely even tangentially relate to ecology and are usually of lower quality content than ecology articles. Lots of videos posted here are of really low quality and I usually remove them for this reason. It's not something that the community really sees. But there is no standards or rules with it, which is not a good thing. With this proposal we would still allow videos (and images) if they were embedded in self posts with some text that expanded on the video/images content. This would increase the quality of the posts, deter lazy/thoughless posts, and help set a standard for the moderators. 

* We are discussing **outright banning posts on subjects such as community agriculture, permaculture, organic farming**, instead referring the posters to the more relevant subreddits above. People are obviously encouraged to subscribe to these sureddits if they are interested in the content.

* We will continue to remove content such as compostable toilets, eco-friendly dishwashing liquid, etc., unless there is a monumental call to allow this sort of content.

----

We also have a list of [ecological terms](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/wiki/terms), [job guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/wiki/jobs), [related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/wiki/subreddits) and to a lesser extent [related books](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/wiki/books) that could do with a large update.

ONE field assistant / camp manager needed for The University of
Michigan Gelada Research Project, a study of the evolutionary biology,
behavior, communication, endocrinology, and conservation of wild
geladas (Theropithecus gelada) - a close relative of baboons. All
research is conducted at a remote field station located in the Simien
Mountains National Park of Ethiopia. Directors of the project are Dr.

Michigan. The successful candidate will be responsible for (a)
collecting basic demographic and reproductive data as part of routine
monitoring of the well-habituated study population, (b) conducting
focal animal samples, taking growth photos, and collecting fecal and
urine samples from individually-recognized geladas (for later
laboratory steroid hormone analysis in the USA), (c) downloading the
data each day to a computer and sending this data back to the U.S. on a
monthly basis, and (d) maintaining camp equipment and managing
personnel. The gelada population has been studied on a near-daily basis
since 2006, and we currently recognize approximately 250 individuals
(that you will learn to identify and love).

Our field station is a stone hut located deep within the national park
that is shared with 0-3 American graduate students (depending on the
time of year).¬† The project employs 3 Ethiopian field assistants, and
1-2 Ethiopian staff (for cooking and cleaning) who live down the path
from the project hut in the Park outpost that consists of 4-5 rangers
and their families. The hut has 3 bedrooms (sleeps 6 comfortably), a
full kitchen set-up (including a propane-powered freezer, and a
propane-powered stove and oven), a propane-powered hot shower, solar
panels to power computers and lights, a generator (for electricity
during the rainy season), a satellite telephone and modem (for email),
and a Toyota 4x4 pickup truck. There is no running water at the
fieldsite, but fresh water is brought to the camp daily from a nearby
spring (and filtered at the camp). For more information on the project
directors, the project publications, and some photos of the fieldsite,
please see the project website:
http://www.umich.edu/~gelada/UMGRP/Home.html.

¬†Qualified applicants will have a B.S. or B.A in Biology, Zoology,
Biological Anthropology, or a related field. Prior travel and/or field
experience in Africa or mountainous regions of Asia or South America
preferred. Applicants must be fluent in English and eager to learn
Amharic (the national language of Ethiopia). Good physical fitness is
absolutely essential - the terrain is hilly, the air is thin (due to
the high elevation), and the temperatures can get quite cold during the
rainy season (nights are sometimes below freezing and days can be
cold). Good organizational skills and experience with basic database
management a must. Must be able to drive a stick-shift 4x4 truck over
rough terrain. Experience with leadership also a plus - as you will
be working closely with several graduate students and field
assistants.

Salary/funding: This is a volunteer position, so there is no salary.
However, round-trip airfare and living support will be provided for the
volunteer (visa expenses, travel, meals, lodging). Additionally,
volunteer will be provided with basic accommodation, food and other
basic supplies while at the field site. The volunteer is responsible
for any additional expenses incurred while traveling in Ethiopia. The
project will provide emergency travel health insurance, but the
volunteer is required to have basic health care coverage and must
acquire the necessary vaccinations prior to entry to Ethiopia. The
volunteer will need to provide their own winter/alpine condition
clothing, footwear and sleeping bag. Advice about what items are
necessary for life in the Simien Mountains will be provided to the
successful applicant.

Appointment: 1-2 years beginning early-May, 2016. Because the training
process requires 2-4 months (mostly learning the animals), the
successful applicant must be willing to work for a minimum of 1 year.
Applicants committing to a longer period will receive one round-trip
flight to their home country halfway through their internship. Note
that 4 (out of 5) previous camp managers have found this experience
quite rewarding and have signed on to a second year. Ethiopia is a safe
and extremely friendly country to live in.

Deadline: Position will remain open until filled. Earlier applications
will receive priority. We hope to fill the position before the end of
February, 2016.

Application: Please email the following materials to Dr. Jacinta
Beehner at¬†jbeehner@umich.edu: (1) a letter of interest stating how and
why this position satisfies your interest and future career goals,
explaining your suitability for this project, plus a time frame during
which you are available to work (when you are free to travel), (2) a CV
or resume detailing relevant experience, (3) a summary of college
courses taken and the grades received, to be followed by an official
transcript, and (4) contact information for at least two references,
preferably at least one academic reference as well as one person who
has worked closely with you or who has closely supervised your work.
The subject heading of the email message should read: Application
for field research position.

66,ecology,Do you know any professor is working on the combination between ecology and information theory or thermodynamics?,"I can name a few: John Harte (Berkeley), James O'Dwyer (Illinois), Brian Fath (Towson). I have contacted all of them, but having three options is risky for me, especially I'm not very strong in TOEFL (only 90).

My proposed research is to look for the relation between thermodynamic and/or information - theoretic entropy in an ecological system. It will be a combination of (1) thermodynamic in ecology, (2) information theory in ecology, and (3) the physical meaning of information entropy. Besides physics, ecology and information theory, having some knowledge of complex systems or system theory would be helpful. Simulation might be needed to check the theory with the observations.

I've never done any kind of research like this on my own.

Background: I live in tampa, florida and drive all over central and south florida for fun.. here are my ideas. (Also, I have to be able to physically test or research this subject.. like go there take temp and pH levels etc..)

My ideas: 
-Something on the ecosystem and habitat of the everglades and alligators? There are gators everywhere 
-sharks? 
-Or invasive species and how it affects our environment ( only question I could actually come up with.. not sure how I could play this out or test it)
 - manatees! 
-or last sea turtles...

-problem- how am I going to come up with a question? Anddd how am I going to test something that hasn't already been tested? Or even go about testing what I need.. I have the most basic tools.. (sensors) not sure if I can take them from class either..

Not asking anyone to do the work for me.. I just want to know if I am going in the right direction.. any advice is appreciated :)",1453142178

I'm particularly interested in competition and the Lotka-Volterra equations, and understanding how they can be affected by things like metapopulations and density dependence. Is there literature that is relatively easy for someone with a light calculus background and basic programming and algorithm design knowledge? Many papers that I've read have gone completely over my head because I have no familiarity with the systems they talk about.

38,ecology,Modeling dispersal kernels in R - A quick guide (with code!),"A couple of months ago I made a post asking if anyone had any advice for modeling dispersal kernels in R. Specifically, I was interested in how to model habitat 'attraction' by dispersing larvae in the water column. I modified a model by White et al. 2009 that simulated dispersal kernels among coastal retention zones, that form when spatial heterogeneities create eddies and sequester larvae. 

There were three dispersal scenarios that I modeled. The first two kernels depend on the ratios of advective flow (La) to stochastic flow (Ls) and can be adjusted to represent retention zones (i.e. lower directional advective flow -&gt; tighter larval distribution around the spawn point). The third kernel was reflective of larvae spawned upstream of a retention zone, but was not based on the flow parameters La and Ls. Instead this model used the ratio of flow relaxation (Lr,created by spatial heterogeneity) to reserve width. A larger reserve or smaller flow relaxation would result in more larval settlement within the retention zone. 

In the first two models, you can adjust La and Ls to represent the 'attractiveness' of a given reserve. We know that larvae are attracted to settlement within reserves through chemical, visual, and auditory cues, and so in a modified model I equate attractiveness to the idea of the retention zone. 

The R code I've included contains the nominal dynamics for each flow scenario from White et al. 2009.

55,ecology,Help a stats noobie out?,"Hi.  Ok, so I'm guessing this is a fairly straightforward thing to do, but I'm pretty naive when it comes to statistics and looking for help.  I helped to conduct a bird foraging study for a class.  We set up ""foraging stations"" that each contained three types of food and then observed them (from a distance with binoculars).  Among other things we recorded the species of each bird that visited a station and the type of food it took while it was there.

There are several questions we are asking of the data, but I'm looking for help with only one here.  I want to know whether the food preferences differ among bird species.  Here are my data:



Species | FoodType1 | FoodType2 | FoodType3
-------|---------|---------|---------
1 | 154 | 226 | 7
2 | 94 | 17 | 15
3 | 272 | 119 | 27
4 | 27 | 123 | 2
5 | 11 | 0 | 0
6 | 0 | 3 | 3
7 | 1 | 0 | 0
8 | 1 | 2 | 0


Looking at the data it looks like species 1 and 4 prefer food type 2 the most, while species 2, 3, and 5 prefer food type 1 the most.  But that's just my gut feeling after looking at the numbers, and there are lots of other potentially interesting comparisons that could be done here.  So what kind of test should I do?  I want to know whether the distributions of food preferences differ among the eight species of birds and, if so, which differ from which.  I can't just do an ANOVA right, because it's not the means that I'm comparing but rather the distributions?  I know a chi-square allows you to compare two distributions with each other but can it be used to compare eight all at once and then tell you specifically which ones differ from which (like a bonferroni does, for example)?

(we have refrigerators or better call those some cooling compartments and shelves that have to work in 2 regimes: 0/+4C and -22/-18C) It also has to be an affordable one because in the scenario we have to replace 60 metric tons of it.

70,ecology,How to input percent cover data for analysis?,"Hey guys,

I have a bunch of percent cover that I need to analyse but I'm not quite sure how I should compile/input it for analysis. 

So, I have foliose algae and substrate data from a number of random point contact (RPC) surveys. The RPC surveys were conducted every 5m along a 30m transect (i.e. 5m, 10m, 15m, 20m, 25m, 30m). I would like to average the percent cover data so that I have one percent cover number for each algae/substrate for the whole transect. For each survey I have 10 values for substrate (substrate was always record, even if there was algae above it) and then any number of values (0-50) for algae.

Part of what is making it hard for me to input is the fact that the total percentage can be over 100%. Normally, I would just divide the total number of observations for a species/substrate by the total number of observations to get the percentage. Since the percentage can be over 100% though, how do I go about this? Do I need to do substrate and algae separately? I realize that I should have probably only recorded substrate if there was nothing else on top of it.

Can anyone help me out?

Thanks.

Edit: Even ignoring the substrate, how do I calculate percent cover since multiple species can be on top of one another? If I'm not counting substrate, would I just add up the total and then divide the number of values for a species by the total?

80,ecology,Ecology homework question.,"**Edit: I have figured it out. I appreciate those who helped, and do not appreciate those who did not. I made a mistake in including insignificant trees in my initial chi squared test**

Hi everybody. I've had a rough week and have apparently lost my Ecology folder including all my notes. I have a lab report due this Wednesday that summarizes field data I took earlier in the semester.

Most of the calculations have been self explanatory, however I've gotten stuck on one of the hypotheses I've been asked to test.

First, I'll explain my data. For several lab periods I observed insectivorous birds and their feeding habits including the species of trees they were foraging on. For each time a bird landed on a tree, its species and the tree's species were tabulated. 

This lead to the following table:

 | Red Maple |Aspen | Cherry | Paper Birch | Red Oak | White Oak | Others | Sum
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
Chickadee | 315 | 195 | 24 | 6 | 2 | 4 | 153 | 699
Nuthatch | 49| 20 | 0|9|0|1|20|99
Creeper |40|17|1|7|0|6|12|83
Red-Bellied |30|18|8|0|3|5|18|82
Downy | 22|18|0|0|4|0|19|63
Hairy | 13|1|0|1|0|3|9|27
Hypothesis 2 asks me to test that : ""The two species of birds are selecting the same species of trees""

In the instructions, it is made clear that this will be a Chi Squared test, these observed values are used to calculate expected values by taking the total number of observed visits to a tree species, multiplying it by the total visits by a bird species and dividing by the total number of visits of both species.

(Row Total x Column Total)/Grand Total

What I don't understand is how these values are used to reject or fail to reject the hypothesis. I have looked at my classmate's work and everybody seems to have taken different approaches to doing this, none of which make any sense to me. Most seem to exclude certain tree species (clumping them into a miscellaneous category) for no apparent reason.

Does anybody have any clue how I should approach this problem.

http://imgur.com/a/ol61Z here are my classmate's data sheets. Hypothesis one tested whether birds are selecting foraging sites at random.

I appreciate anybody's assistance.

Still, there are so many diverse taxa of animals that can see UV that it seems like there have to be some more diverse uses for it other than prey identification and sexual advertising. For example, I understand that mammal urine will reflect UV and that it can be used by predatory bird to find trails of mammals through grass and so focus their foraging effort. I'm looking to create a bit of library of things that are strong reflectors of UV light and I'd really appreciate any you can contribute as mentions or more detailed references. Thanks so much.

&amp;nbsp;
What's up /r/ecology, I got some stories for you guys today. If you have a story to share, don't be afraid to share it!

&amp;nbsp;
So this happened this past summer, during summer camp. We have a lot of summer camps at the nature center, and all of them take advantage of what the park and neighborhood has to offer. One of our environmental educators, (we'll call her Toria) had led a group around the lagoon for a camp that explored nature in the city. The lagoon has a lot of downed trees that the County Parks department felled and left there as a teaching tool and habitat for decomposers. One such tree is a downed cottonwood that lies on the ground about 3-4 feet high. So one of the kids broke away from the group and climbed on top of the tree and looked over the lagoon. He then jumps down, like the other kids had done earlier, but this time it was different. You see, once the kid touched the ground, he immediately started crying his eyes out. Toria went over and told him that it was alright and for him to get up. He wouldn't budge, saying ""My leg feels like its on fire!"" My boss Eric, and the resident tough guy/ community programs guy T-Dawg went out to help assist. Toria, Eric, and T-Dawg all said that it would be alright and he needed to get up so he could get some medical attention. He refused to budge, saying that his leg didn't hurt at all but he knew it felt like it was broken. He explained ""I'm crying cause I know I'm not going to ever stop crying"". We then called 911, and he got taken to the hospital, where it was revealed that he broke his leg below the ankle. He ended up being fine later though. 

&amp;nbsp;
**TL;DR**: kid jumps off 4 foot tall log, breaks leg

&amp;nbsp;
So one day last year, we had a community event, basically an Autumn environmental festival which usually draws a lot of people from the neighborhood. We have a unique community, which (like previous stories, has *weird* people) draws many people, including ones who *really* shouldn't be left alone. So this guy came in and we immediately thought he was sketchy. He was walking reeaally slow, wore like 15 jackets, had 3 backpacks, and wore crappy upside down sunglasses. He was walking around aimlessly and had a camera and was fiddling with a camera. He then goes to one of my co workers, Chakira and says she looks ""really sexy"" and takes a picture of her. In fact he takes a picture of **ALL** of my female coworkers. Immediately, Eric and T-Dawg went to ""talk"" to the guy. He was quietly escorted off the premises. It turns out this guy was a homeless, creepy and high af guy who lived in all the bus stops and buses in the neighborhood.

&amp;nbsp;
**TL;DR**: creepy af, high af homeless guy goes full pedo on my female employees, is escorted outta the building

I'll be back next week!

I am rather new to GIS as well as the Geospatial Modelling Programme. Right now, I am trying to figure out the home range for one of my focal individuals. 

While using the Geospatial Modelling Programme's kde (Kernel Density Estimate) I input the Lat and Long coordinates ( that look like this -25.0281632	26.4352982) (those are made up) through a shp file that was converted into a CSV. However, when I go into R and attempt to get the bandwith, I get the following: 1,] 4.345774e-06 0.000000e+00
[2,] 0.000000e+00 6.046336e-06

That is fine, however, when I plug these into the geospatial modelling programme and get an img. It seems incredibly inaccurate and does not encompass the GPS fixes that I attached them to. I also tried to do change the Bandwidth to SCV, however, the same results. 

I have roughly 2000 gps coordinates and I used a cell size (in geospatial modelling) of 10. 

Does anyone have any solutions on how to fix this? I know that this is kind of a silly and somewhat complex and vague question, but I have been working on it for hours and I cannot figure it out. 

Do the geographic coordinates simply not compliment the programme? Is the cell size too small? I am simply perplexed and any help would be much obliged. Likewise, I also have the option of using ECEF_Y	ECEF_Z
and LONG X and LONG Y coordinates (as this data was from a GPS collar).

&amp;nbsp;

What's up /r/ecology, I'm back again to share a story. Don't forget to share yours!

&amp;nbsp;
Most stories come from my job as an urban naturalist and urban environmental educator, so I've seen a fair share of weird stuff. This story is about something almost fatal that happened one day at work. So during winter, the lagoon next to our building freezes over, and we rent out ice skates and hockey gear to people and make the lagoon into an ice skating rink. So one day when the season was coming to a close, and we didn't allow people on the ice anymore since the ice was thin, we saw two figures moving across the ice. Someone who held my current position (we'll call him Danny), went outside to investigate. Sure enough, there was two girls who moved across the ice to get onto one of the islands in the lagoon. As soon as they started to come back, the ice cracked, and one of the two girls fell in a little bit. Danny sees this and calls 911, and proceeds to yell at the girls once the paramedics got them to shore. Danny says ""Are you dumb? Can you not read this sign, this sign that you passed when you got into the pool? The sign that says 'DANGER: THIN ICE'?"" That's when we learned why they went onto the island. We had canoed to the island during the previous summer, and the two girls didn't get to go on the canoe trip. So they decided to go on their own trip to the island, in the end of winter, on thin ice. 

&amp;nbsp;
**TL;DR**: two girls go on an island adventure only to realize that they went on thin ice and almost fell in.

80,ecology,rangeland management: want to learn more about it,"Hello!  I am a college freshmen double majoring in geology and environmental science.  My longstanding interests have always been more catered to conservation, and wildlife.  I grew up on a farm and was completely fascinated by managing grazing cattle and assessing their impact on our pastures, as well as making sure we had space for native grasses.  I also grew to love stream ecology, because I spent all my free time looking for wildlife in the creeks and playing with the rocks, plants and water.

Why am I majoring in geology?  **I feel like it's a safety net**.  From here I can *kind of* get into watershed management, while having the stable career field of environmental consulting as a back-up.  *I'm terrified that if I made the jump to resource management and/or wildlife ecology, I wouldn't get a job at all.*  At least with geology, I will still have the opportunity for outdoor work and a stable paycheck, even if I cannot fulfill my passions.

Taking a career inventory test through university career counseling, it was suggested that ""Rangeland Management Specialist"" would be an ideal career for me.  What struck me about it was that it was *interdisciplinary*, and would grant me the opportunity to work outdoors with ranchers, wildlife biologists, and all manner of people concerning America's rangeland's.  I cannot stress how important enticing *interdisciplinary* sounds to me.  What terrifies me about geology (and academia in general) is that I only get to study minute details and be around the same type of people for my entire career.  I don't *just* want to focus on water chemistry, or rock composition, but the relationship between *every single* part of the environment.  Because it concerns both wildlife *and* domestic grazing livestock, you can bet that the romanticism hit me really hard. I fell for geology because of the ""heroic"" depictions of helicopters, mountain climbers, and scientists saving towns from volcanoes.  Now I'm falling for rangeland management due to similar depictions of workers on horseback and broad vistas where domestic cattle and native species can exist in harmony.  I'm such a stupid romanticist. You'll notice I keep using this, in almost every post on reddit.  It's the only thing I know about myself.

However, there isn't much I can find online about the actual nature of the work, other than a few videos, pictures, and articles.  It seems to be a very small field that I wouldn't have a good chance of getting into.

Thank you for reading this far.  I'll try to summarize this ramble into some basic questions.  *Can anyone here provide me with a basic outlook and description of rangeland ecology?  Can I expect a stable career?  How does this fit in with my current double major of geology and environmental science?  Would stream ecology be an entirely separately field, or could I cater a degree that would give me a chance to line up in both?

Money has never really mattered to me.  If I have the balls by the time I graduate, I will join the peace corps and hopefully do an environmental-oriented stint.  Upon return I would like a (partially outdoor) stable job that could allow for living in a community and have an impact.  I would love to be that eccentric guy who lives with an amazing dog and does animal rehabilitation on the side.  

Sorry.  This is **way** to wushy gushy and unrealistic.  I need to learn to wipe the romanticism clean before I talk.  I fully understand that any job, especially in conservation/environmental science/ecology, is going to deal with bureaucracy and paperwork.  I would just like a stable job that would get me out in the boonies every once in a while.  Am I approaching all of this with the completely wrong mindset?

89,ecology,Doing a Literature Review on Wildlife Farming and looking for papers,"Hello /r/ecology,

I'm looking for papers for a lit review I'm doing, as the title says. My project seeks to assess the conservation impacts of wildlife farming.

Illegal wildlife trade is an escalating threat to biodiversity conservation globally.  Some proposals suggest that wildlife farming, including cultivation and ranching of wild plants and animals, can help to reduce consumer pressures on wild populations.

Despite contentious policy debates about wildlife farming, the verdict on its impacts on species conservation and habitats remains uncertain. This review is crucial to strengthening the evidence-base for future decisions, including at CITES CoP 17. 

I am looking for relevant grey literature and case studies from organisations and institutions engaged in wildlife farming, wildlife ranching, wildlife trade, wild plant cultivation, and aquaculture. 
This includes working papers, project documents, impact assessments, and other unpublished (non-peer reviewed) material that provide evidence or discussion of the various positive or negative impacts of wildlife farming on the conservation of habitat and biodiversity.

I am primarily looking for case studies that have in some way sought to assess the conservation impacts of the wildlife farming and related interventions such as ranching, aquaculture and plant cultivation. I am interested in all papers that consider:

* Impacts on the conservation of target, farmed species
* Impacts on other species (e.g. animals used for feedstock for carnivorous farmed animals).
* Impacts on broader habitat conservation
* Implications for and preferences of consumers to farmed wildlife 
* Speculation about the impacts of wildlife farming 


If you have anything, could you post links to academic papers here? 

Thank you very much.",1443605037
