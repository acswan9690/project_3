12,environmental_science,Local Moran’s I vs Getis-Ord Gi* for Cluster/Hotspot Analysis," Hello! I'm a health researcher, and I was wondering if someone here could perhaps help explain the difference between these two methods and when it might be more appropriate to use one vs the other for cluster/hotspot analysis (I'm studying diabetes and prediabetes prevalence by census tract)? I imagine these spatial/geographic methods are used quite extensively in environmental and geosciences so I thought I'd try asking here! 

I understand that **local Moran's I** allows you to identify both **statistically significant clusters** (areas of high value surrounded by high value neighbors aka hotspots &amp; areas of low value surrounded by low value neighbors aka coldspots) as well as **statistically significant outliers** (areas of high value surrounded by low value neighbors and areas of low value surrounded by high value neighbors) .

By contrast **Getis-Ord Gi\*** only seems to find statistically significant clusters/hotspots/coldspots and not outliers like local Moran's I does.

What are some other differences between these methods that are relevant to deciding which to use to study the prevalence of a disease by census tract? Is it just whether you'd like to find outliers or not? If local Moran's I has no disadvantages since it can find both outliers and clusters why does anyone use Getis-Ord Gi\* if it can only find clusters and not outliers? What is the advantages for it? Is the way neighbors are found different for one vs the other?",1630944030

42,environmental_science,Best practices for falling head hydraulic conductivity tests.,"Hi everyone

I am currently looking at performing a falling head test with some equipment I have set up. I have found a few papers describing the process. 

Briefly: get constant flow through the column, hold the flow, take a head measurement, release the flow and start timing and then once it reaches a desired distance you stop the time and take that as your second head value. It’s a constant difference in head you’re timing.  

I presented my proposal within my department as part of degree when someone commented on why I wasn’t taking multiple heads as part of best practices. I’ve looked through quite a few papers and can not find what he was referring to? From what I can tell it’s the same head measurement over a couple of times to get an average K value for a soil. But I cannot for the life of me find what he is referring to. I have tried to ask for some clarification but he has been unable to do so.

Does anyone know what best practices he is referring to? Is it perhaps part of The ASTM?

Thanks in advance",1630410111

This document authored by ‘World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED)’ on the subject of ‘Sustainability’ was published in 1987. This document is also called the ‘Brundtland Report’ owing to Norwegian Prime Minister Brundtland who chaired WCED. The drafting of the document was an exercise of 900 days that cataloged, analyzed, synthesized written submissions and testimony of scientists, experts, institutes, NGOs, and the general public. Firstly, the text defined ‘Sustainable development’ as ‘development which meets the requirements of today without compromising future generations’ ability to satisfy their own needs.

93,environmental_science,Calculating the Cost of Climate Change," 

Hello all,

For a math internal assessment, I'm trying to determine the impact of climate change on tourism in the Caribbean. I've done my research, I know about and (partially) understand the D.I.C.E and R.I.C.E models, but I am struggling to derive the precise formulas and equations which I will need. If any one knows of any helpful studies or ways in which I can go about achieving this idea or attaining these formulas, please let me know! Also, if you have any other suggestions on similar ideas, please don't hesitate to share with me. The project just has to be fairly mathematically in-depth, but only to an advanced highschool/early college level.

I enjoy Calculus, so any ideas falling along that spectrum would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!!",1629655241

98,environmental_science,Undergraduate dissertation advice?,"My dissertation topic regards the design of artificial wetlands for flood attenuation. The main question that I want my research to answer, is the effect of vegetation density (in plants per square metre) on the return period of flood events.

However, my supervisor thinks that this might not be feasible for an undergraduate-level dissertation, due to the lack of relevant data. But they are not too sure. I'm meeting with a catchment manager at my local municipality to discuss this on Monday.

Assuming there is a lack of data, is there a realistic way for me to answer this research question? Can I simulate the data (like simulate how different densities of obstacles affect flow conveyance)?",1629599021
99,environmental_science,Not really sure that this field is for me (advice?),"Hi, everyone. I'm a college junior studying Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences with a concentration in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology. Like many of my peers, I don't really know what I want to do in the future. I was okay with that uncertainty because I've met a lot of people in this field who eventually found their path. However, the more people I meet, the more uncertain I am that this is right for me. 

Career paths that I've been exposed to in some way and have considered include naturalist at a nature center, government wildlife technician/biologist, or resource technician/forestry. I just feel like so many jobs in this field end up being extremely competitive for little reward/pay. Maybe I just haven't been exposed to enough, but I can't see a path that I want to end up on. I enjoy working outside to some degree, but most of the work I've done ends up feeling like just manual labor, which isn't something that fits me. I'm just feeling very stressed out because I don't know if I can enjoy a job in this field. I'm already in a bit of debt which makes me feel even worse about all of this.

I’ve been working the past couple years on developing a a sculpture made from a special mortar made from all natural materials. It is made from oyster shells and menhaden oil, which makes its a better material for growing oysters and attracting marine life for rebuilding ecosystems. It also avoids using foreign substances that leach into the water and harm wildlife like a lot of traditional oyster growth. I designed it to create a tide pool to support more growth and provide a surface for egrets and herons to stand on to survey water or hunt. 


I’ve studied the efficacy of creative arts integration in science lessons and they resulted in increased knowledge retention, comprehension, interest levels, and desire to learn more about the topic. I think a public art piece is a great way to educate the public about environmental issues and my goal is to create art that educates and improves the environment, I make art from trash that I pick up from wetlands that I study as well.

One of the larger sections of woods near me, (still probably only an acre or two) has a stream that has become so deeply cut by erosion that it is in some places six feet deep. 

The roots of nearby trees get more exposed with each rain, and the runoff from roads and lawns nearby only accelerates the process. 

A telephone pole that was once on one side of the creek now has its foundation exposed and is standing in the stream itself.

As the land is trampled by runoff it seems to become more and more muddy, and i see trees seem like they might be starting to lean. 

All this has happened to the point i am worried the forest will either: be examined by the county, deemed irrecoverable or dangerous and mostly cut down, or the stream will be eroded and the soil softened by runoff so much that the forest nearby will collapse around it.  

These woods have personal sentimental value to me, and it's very possible i am catastrophizing due to how much i care for them. My degree is in biology not environmental science, so i wanted to get an accurate assessment on just how fucked these woods are, and if i should try and do something about it. 

Here are some pictures of the area. [https://imgur.com/a/dgMDlFS](https://imgur.com/a/dgMDlFS)

I took Calc 1 and elementary statistics (received an A in both) and chem 1 and chem 2 (A in the former, B in the later). I took a geochemistry class and a biodiversity class). I also took an environmental law class. I also took a capstone where I focused on environmental education. I also took two advance classes in both invasive species and food (agriculture mostly). My gpa was a 3.2 (I failed french two, long story lol). 

&amp;#x200B;

13,environmental_science,Should I get 4 Associate's AND a Bachelor's?,"I am currently enrolled in a community college to complete lower division classes before transferring to a university. I originally went with the intention to get an AS-T in Environmental science, which will be pursued as a bachelors no matter what, and a certificate in water resources management as well as university-level general ed. It is a 3-year long plan, full time. I am about to enter my third year.  


 Very recently, I discovered I can actually get a Biology AS and Water Resource management AS too with my current workload. I was planning on transferring after spring 22, but due to a mishap in my original plan, I will have to go an extra fall semester to take a specific physics series in order to transfer unless I make things VERY difficult for myself this year, OR lose the biology AS. However, if I go the extra semester (or year, since I really don't wanna transfer to a spring semester) I would also be able to pick up an AS in geology, an AS in natural sciences, a micro credential in GIS, and maybe even an AS in chemistry or general science. The only reason why I am hesitant about the idea in the first place is because I am very enthusiastic to finally move out as soon as possible, and the idea of going to a community college for 4 years sounds kind of unappealing.  


Now I am wondering: Would it be worth it to attend that extra time to pick up those extra degrees/certs, specially in California? Would they be helpful career-wise if I am pursuing something related to natural science/resource mgmt? I have been told that it would almost be like having masters in all those things but earning them backwards. Is this true, and should I go the extra year or just ditch the biology and finish my education with a BS in Environmental Science and an AS in Water Resource mgmt?",1627765646

I have recently graduated with a degree in Environmental Chemistry. When I decided to pursue this degree, I was completely fascinated with chemistry and I was really looking into applying what I learned actively. I decided pursuing a degree in env. Chem to be worth while. While pursuing this degree, I developed more directed interests in analytical chemistry and data science, as a result of my research experiences and internships. 

I have found data science to be a very interesting field to further pursue studies in, as I find it to be a very versatile skill, that can practically be applied to any field, including env. chemistry and analytical chemistry. I strongly believe that machine learning and deep learning applications can be integrated into optimizing preexisting analytical instruments, and to other aspects of environmental science as well. 

People of r/environmental_science, has anyone here have had their feet in both these two fields? If so, is there any advice that you can impart and/or provide examples of how you use data science in your day to day work? I am really passionate about these subjects.

1,environmental_science,What are Nano bubbles?,"I am working for years with nano bubble generating devices. The smaller the bubbles, the more mass transfer happens. Since NBs are not rising and follow a Brownian motion in the water, they can survive for months and will be spread out in the whole water column like fog. Once a certain dissolved oxygen gradient exists, the bubbles dissolve their gas content in the water. NB are like little batteries in the water and don't follow Henry's law. This means we can load up water with many more gas particles than the water can dissolve.   


[Nano bubbles in a cistern](https://preview.redd.it/ppmaba76z9b71.jpg?width=4128&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0f7fe78e0c263e1f997559f6390982732bd72114)

Algae removal in lakes means stopping a long chain reaction at the source:  Phosphates, Ammonia, Nitrates and Nitrites are commonly referred to as nutrients.  These nutrients are feeding aerobic bacteria that consume Oxygen and in turn produce CO2. The CO2 in turn is the food for the blue algae that then starts to populate in the lake exponential and produces deadly toxins that kill all lake inhabitants that still survived the oxygen depletion.    


To break this chain, nano bubbles will oxidize the nutrients and make them unavailable to the bacteria. They also float suspended solids to the surface and thus leave lakes with a pristine transparency.   


Industrial nano bubble generators make 500+ billion nano bubbles per ml of processed water. These machines process up to 3700 liters per minute, so the amount of produced nano bubbles is just totally staggering. With a 85% gas transfer rate these systems leave little room for gas losses on the surface. 

Nano bubbles are a superior chemical-free water treatment. No residuals. They disappear in two to three months. 

Anti scaling in chiller towers, washing and disinfection of fruits and vegetables, aqua culture, hydroponics with a 20-60 % increase in production, NB are not in it's infancy.

I'm currently writing my Masters in Geology and had a bit of a fuck up  regarding my data. I lost all of the weather data from the Taza region  of Morocco. I don't know how, but now it's gone. The problem is I can't  seem to find the data online since I don't know where to look. It was  from november 2009 to august 2012 and I got it ages ago from another  student who no longer has a copy.  Now to my question. Where can i find over 10 year old datasets of hourly  air temperature and either hourly dew point or relative humidity.

I been meaning to post my resume to this reddit page but have been feeling a bit underqualified. I have taken a few classes in regards to the analytical side of Chemistry and overall Biochemistry and my confidence is much higher.

I want to apply to internships in relation to anything water or environment related (water testing, treatment/distribution). If you know of other internships or overall lab jobs in this subject, please let me hear it.

My question and point of creating this post, how can I better fix my resume to cater to this field? I attached my resume below. Thanks for the advice!

25,environmental_science,Building more sustainable cities: What has to be done vs. what people want (academic survey),"Hey all!

My  name is João Monteiro and I'm a PhD. student in the Doctoral Program of  Spatial Planning at the University of Coimbra, Portugal.

Cities are our prime habitat. Due to a number different reasons, people have been moving from rural areas to urban areas. Many cities were created and developed due to need and not thinking about what is best in the long term. But that has been changing! For the past few years scientific research, world wide organizations and even governments are commited to improve our urban areas, make them more sustainable, resilient and efficient.

My  research project, titled 'Form and function: Benchmarking real and  ideal cities' aims to provide quantitative evidences, based on a set of  indicators (from urban planning, design, transport planning,...) that  are able to provide knowledge on how to adapt urban planning in order to  improve city's sustainability, resiliency, efficiency, amount others.

  
So far so good but... there is one important factor that when focusing on specific analysis we tend to forget: pleasantness - do people like to live where they live?  
One  of my analysis consists of the perceive pleasantness that people have  about neighborhoods where they would like (or dislike) to live in. To  help me better understand people choices, I create a 10minutes survey  that consists of looking at 25 different images from neighborhoods  around the world and asking, on a scale from 1 to 5, if people would  like to live there just considering the pleasantness of said  neighborhoods.

If anyone reading this, has 10 minutes to spare and could participate on the survey would be amazing and would help me a lot.

The link for the survey: [https://ls.uc.pt/index.php/754364?lang=en](https://ls.uc.pt/index.php/754364?lang=en)

Thank you so much for the help.

Cheers from Portugal

PS: I know that this isn't a research directly connected to environmental science, however, the reality is that everything is connected and without any doubt, cities have to improve in all senses for a better, more sustainable and resilient future. On the path towards that, we have to create an environmental that people like and see themselves living there. Thats were this part of my research enters. Again, thank you much for all the help and support :D",1626102301

I have already acquired my HAZWOPER 40 HR, but I am trying to do more. I am trying to get the Geoscientist-In-Training designation, but cannot decide what test to take, or if it even matters so long as I pass the test. In my state of Texas, you can decide to take one of the following to become a GIT

* ASBOG Fundamentals of Geology exam
* CSSE Fundamentals of Soil Science exam
* Texas Geophysics exam

Right now I am on the fence between the ASBOG and CSSE. If anyone who has already done something like this could give me some info I would greatly appreciate it.

It logically seems to me that it's much more energy efficient to cool homes that are too hot for human living than it is to warm up places that are too cold, yet the west only rages about air conditioning, not people heating their homes in places that are too cold to live. 

When taking a step back and looking at it logically, if a Norwegian criticizes Americans for living in say, Nevada, doesn't that person consume far less energy to cool their home than the Norwegian does to warm up said house in the winter? People just want to focus on overall American energy consumption without focusing on the actual things that are being consumed and why.

I think my overall point, is that it's not what we're doing in the places we're doing them, it's the how. Desalination plants from renewable sources can bring fresh water to a desert without extreme global impacts. Geothermal can be harnessed to bring up cooler air, the list goes on. 

Why is there so much hatred for AC and things American do? Energy consumption isn't the issue, it's energy generation for said consumption. Humans will increasingly use more energy for the betterment of the man and hopefully the planet, we should be *encouraging* its use *in excess* and manage the sources of that energy to not harm the planet.

I graduated from UT Austin in 2020 with a degree in History where I studied Environmental History and Indigenous Populations. After soul searching, I’ve found that I want to pursue environmental work for a living rather than academia in environmental history. So now I have two options: I can return to UT Austin and start a major in Geography (since it was in the College of Liberal Arts like History) and try to transfer into environmental science (College of Natural Sciences). If I can’t successfully transfer, I can choose to focus on biogeography and climate change in that specific major track. OOORRRRR I can go to the University of Denver for an MS in Environmental Policy. I’ve already been accepted. My only thing is: I won’t have to pay anything at UT Austin, I can potentially pursue a Masters or Ph.D. down the road if I want to, but for now I wouldn’t owe anything. I would, however, owe money at DU and would finish with the master’s, but I wouldn’t have any real environmental science foundations. Just the policy, more or less.

Some of these things like nitrogen can be replaced by mycorrhizae, but what about the elements that are not replenished. I started thinking about lawns where we cut the grass and bag the leaves and take them to landfills. There’s fertilizer but it probably doesn’t replace all the things that get removed. And I’m wondering, are we basically depleting all the soils everywhere we do these things, taking important elements from the soil and sending them to dumps? Eventually, won’t we only have soil left in a lot of places that doesn’t have enough of the full scope of nutrients that the native plants need since we’re basically selectively removing them by never returning the plant matter to where it came from?",1623725868

I'm not sure if this has already been implemented or attempted someplace in the world or on some CAD but wouldn't you be able to use the carbon emissions from something like a factory to produce electricity? This is somewhat like my general understanding of hydroelectricity where water pushes a turbine or something of that nature producing electricity from kinetic energy. Wouldn't the rising carbon dioxide/gas emissions be able to push some sort of turbine (maybe one that's really light)  to create electricity as it's already being released it'd just have another use before being emitted into the atmosphere?  Would the emissions not be enough to create rotation or would the potential energy created not be worth the time and effort to create something like this? Or would it be something else entirely?

I'm in my mid 20s, looking at going to university and studying environmental science. My question is, did studying it take away from your enjoyment of nature? My absolute favourite spots in the world are all natural environments. A waterfall near where I live, a sugar pine forest I often drive a couple of hours to just to explore, a rainforest just north of here. 

I'm just curious as to whether becoming an expert on this stuff takes away from any of the mystic. Sometimes in life the wonder comes from the unknown. I don't want to be going into a forest and only thinking in equations and numbers, if that makes sense.

I’m interested in this school primarily because their tuition costs are much lower than others (Oregon, Florida State) but this also makes me suspicious of the quality of the education. I’ve seen a few comments comparing SNHU to University of Phoenix online and don’t want to make a bad choice for my BS.

This episode is dedicated to plastic and its effects on the environment. I sat down with Alexis Goldsmith: National Organizing Director for Beyond Plastic. Beyond Plastic was founded by Judith Enck; a Regional EPA Administrator under President Obama. It's a nonprofit dedicated to eliminating single-use plastic and changing the way we use plastic entirely. We talked about the plastic creation process, its effect on the environment, and how common microplastic is (we eat a credit card worth a week!). She brought facts and expertise to talk about all that is plastic and its detrimental impact. *Footnote from Alexis: ""At around 9:30, I say that Methane is 89 times more potent than Carbon. It's actually 30x, so I misspoke. The 89 number is also repeated at 11:49.""",1620830260

Our cat was euthanized last week. Per vets advice, we were sure to take all precautions for wildlife when burying, and google said the drugs might seep into the soil for a year after burial. We are wanting to make the site into a little meditation area, and fresh catnip for our other cat.

We are concerned our other cat would ingest catnip at this site and be poisoned as the chemicals leech into the soil and roots grow deeper. Should we wait a year before planting, or never plant in this space? Will the chemicals only go down, or also out and up? Is there anything we can do to help the soil? We hit a wall of granite under the site, if that matters.

If you want to go into the science for other readers of this sub, I very much respect that. I just ask you answer my question definitively/kindly before going too far into the gory facts, as my heart is broken.

62,environmental_science,A question on the ETS (EU cap and trade),"I’ve been reading into the ETS (European Union Cap and Trade System) and I wanted to ask a few questions to further my understanding. 

So I know that the ETS determines a set cap on emissions allocated in carbon tonnes which can be substituted to the equivalent in other green house gases. 

Countries in the EU put forward a case for some free permits. However how are the auctioned permits allocated? 

I’ve read on the EU respective website that countries receive revenue from the auction of these permits so does the EU give each member state an amount to auction off? Or is it instead that they are auctioned off centrally? Is so how do the member countries get the revenue? 

Hope that all makes sense.",1620309255

I said okay because I thought that learning new things would help me and my future career too. Out of these 21 days, I went out on field training 2 days and the rest was in the office feeling uncomfortable because the girl who supposed to train me (let’s name her Jenny) doesn’t talk or teach me anything. She seems like the one with anger issues because she would get mad and scream out loud when the scanner or internet is slow. She doesn’t train me, doesn’t talk to me, doesn’t let me do anything, and the only thing she had me do was running errands for her. Jenny was working with another girl who was quitting when I was hired and she seemed to talk, joke, and laugh a lot (3 of us work together for a couple days) but after working with me, she acts like I’m not existing. Jenny would get pissed when I ask her questions about work or ask her if she needs help. The work environment seems very toxic. The manager doesn’t talk/train me. She just let Jenny do whatever she wants with me. I was excited when I got an offer and willing to drive 2ish hours front and back for this position but it doesn’t turn out well.

* **What are relevant issues in Env. studies?**

 **(My experience: transboundary harm, migratory species, traditional environmental knowledge. I also gravitate towards nuclear waste disposal or climate change &lt;though they are quite broad and popular&gt;)**

TL;DR

I am considering applying for several Masters programs abroad (I m not from the US) in Env. Studies (not Science). Those are multidisciplinary, involve some science, policy, law, management, economics. I had some experience with international environmental law through awards in Moot courts. 

**\[**My research topics involved transboundary harm, migratory species, traditional environmental knowledge. On the other hand, I worked in Big4 as a legal consultant, with direct involvement in projects on desertification resulting from oil drilling**.\]**

In my research proposal due in July I need to choose a topic that could link to my legal background. I hope this will enable me to somehow justify my transition into Env. Studies. I would appreciate any insights from those involved in similar programs / who had a similar experience. My research topic should gravitate towards interdisciplinary scope, combining law/policy aspects with Env Sc. Having searched on my own, I found nuclear waste disposal, the climate change framework worth looking at.

My chances of getting into are quite low, esp. compared to overproductive applicants with directly relevant backgrounds, though it's worth trying.",1618508353

I wanted to ask if there is such a position that marries together research of some sort (office setting I'm assuming?) and actual exploration/expeditions in a natural setting. That would honestly be a dream. Ever since I was in the 9th grade, I always looked up to the national geographic explorers and the people you'd see in documentary, but I never pursued it because I didn't think it was realistic for me. I thought it was so amazing. Now, I'm seriously considering changing my major to environmental science because of this. As a side question, because I've already done 2 semesters-worth of computer science coursework, could this be a beneficial minor for me? Thanks in advance guys.",1617896165

Unsure if this is the right sub for this.
I am just am average Joe with no real education however I am curious.

How long (I know its broad) at our current rate of consumption (food,rubbish,emmisions,fishing,deforestation) can the earth sustain the human population ? I know scientifically there will be varying answers on topics however I was hoping an average would present itself

Is human ignorance and greed two major factors in rectifying any of the damage we have and are causing ?

What would it take for the population to make any major changes ? 

I feel like we as human beings are currently reactive instead of proactive and its always to issues we have caused

My thought here is that I can create an oasis in this desert region lush with trees over several decades... but what am I not anticipating?

\- Could a well with no nearby neighbors for 50+miles sustain such a constant pull? What if I pumped the water uphill so that it would gather into a small pond that might serve to refill the well?

\- If I dug out the channels in advance and lined them with rock and gravel I expect to create consistent placement of the rivers... would this work though?

\- I Imagine the land underneath of the waterflow becomes unstable, and would keep it a fair distance from any building site... but how far away from the river might land become more unstable as a result?

I'm a freshman computer science major considering switching over to environmental science. I enjoy cs, but over the past few months, I've been looking into some stuff about the environment that made me feel really passionate. I can't identify whether this should remain an interest for me, or if I should change my major/career path.

Around 4 months ago, I went vegan for some environmental reasons after finding myself in a YouTube rabbit-hole about the topic. From there, I started coming across other documentaries and YouTube videos about pollution and how it's affecting the environment and wildlife. This inspired me to start caring about my own impact and start implementing ways to use less plastic/create less waste, all things I never would've thought I'd care about. In addition to this, a hobby that I already had has been going on backpacking trips and safari-type things. I've always loved being outside and I now have a strong passion for protecting the environment, too.

My question is, are there realistically an environmental science jobs that would suit these interests of mine, including the portion about being outdoors and traveling? I don't think there is such an opportunity (that I know of) in computer science to work outside like this. My original plan was to just major in computer science because I know it is something I also like, but then go on trips/volunteer to help the environment here and there as a mere interest. However, I know a lot of people say it is good to follow your passion, so I don't know if I'll regret not changing my major to environmental science.",1615481954

1. How is it applied to the actual job? Is it a process of collecting spatial info and using a GIS program such as ArcMap to work with the data and display it?

2. For those with jobs/internships, has the knowledge of GIS expanded the options of environmental science related work? In other words, how marketable of a skill is it?

I am currently in the process of applying for the Mitacs Accelerate Program internship. Their page can be found here: [https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/accelerate)  


Essentially I have had to create a research proposal with my topic being, ""How to Incorporate New Technology into the Environmental Consulting Field"". The final stage of this process requires me to recommend 6 industry professionals (in anything relating to environmental work) to act as reviewers for my proposal (essentially just having to say whether they believe if the research is worth doing or not). The commitment to the project is minimal as you will be required to read through the proposal (only a few pages in length), answer approximately 5 short questions, and then provide a recommendation whether the research is worth conducting.  


As I am not in touch with many industry professionals that wouldn't be considered a conflict of interest, I am in hopes that there will be a couple of people available on this sub to help me out.  


I would really appreciate any help and if it matters to anyone I am located in Alberta, Canada.

Probably there is a generally agreed upon rule, like if this amount doesnt affect living things in the area, then even smaller amount is ok to dispose.

23,environmental_science,Understanding/parsing these air quality units.,"Hello all, 

I hope I'm in the right place, please correct/redirect me if I'm not.

I recently purchased an air quality [sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4632) to make an IoT air quality device for my parents, but I'm having trouble understanding the data. The [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/4632/4505_PMSA003I_series_data_manual_English_V2.6.pdf) doesn't seem to offer the information I'm looking for and it's not all in English.

The product page says:

* PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10.0 concentration in both standard &amp; environmental units
* Particulate matter per 0.1L air, categorized into 0.3um, 0.5um, 1.0um, 2.5um, 5.0um, and 10um size bins
* As well as checksum, in binary format.

The data printed in a serial console shows up as:

{'pm10 env': 0, 'pm100 env': 0, 'pm100 standard': 0, 'particles 03um': 147,                                                                                                              'pm25 standard': 0, 'particles 10um': 10, 'pm10 standard': 0, 'pm25 env': 0,                                                                                                              'particles 05um': 47, 'particles 25um': 2, 'particles 100um': 0, 'particles                                                                                                              50um': 2}


What I'm looking for: A way to translate this data into ""your air quality is poor/fair/good"" so that I can display that information alongside the raw data. Does anyone know of resources I can find to help me do this? My googling is failing me/I am only finding basic articles explaining what PM is, etc.

I appreciate any help, this seems like a nice little community I'm intruding into.


Edit: I've found info on converting PM2.5 to AQI which is helpful, but are PM1.0 and PM10.0 relevant to AQI/air quality? What about ""Standard"" units vs ""Environmental"" units? What about particulate matter per 0.1L air? What could that be used for? Thanks again.",1614474162

My job location would be a chemical waste facility site. I’ll be doing RCRA inspections and water sampling. I previously worked at my state parks department, and had to wear long sleeves, thick pants, and boots. Since I haven’t had a chance to speak with anyone about specifics yet, but i maaaay be a little excited to start work and get adequate clothing, i was wondering what the typical work clothing is like for this type of job. For some context, i live in the Northeast in a city with harsh winters and hot summers. Do y’all think I need steel toe boots for the work site? is this the kind of site where i need full coverage from top to bottom? I will be working outside but I won’t be crawling through dirt and thorns so i don’t think I’ll be needing a thick pair of pants. I was thinking of ordering some hiking type pants that have a stretchable waist. (i am a woman). since there will be transitions from the field to the office in the same day, i want something I’ll be able to wear both in the field and in the office. Lastly, if i do need steel toes, I’ve heard a lot of good things about xena footwear, the only issue is that they don’t go as high up as normal work boots, but they are very comfortable, osha certified, steel toe, waterproof and they have a look that would make going from the field to the office very easy.

Looking for some motivation to pursue a career in forestry, so any insight or personal experiences can be super beneficial

I Am currently attending college as an Environmental Studies major while also working. Am I able to obtain a job in forestry after graduating with a degree in Environmental Studies? When I look at most careers in the forestry field it seems like they want a degree in Forestry, Natural Resources, or related fields. The school I am attending has no programs like these listed. Closest being Environmental Studies. Does a degree in Environmental Studies qualify as a ""Natural Resource"" or ""Forestry"" related field?

I applied to transfer to a school where I would major in Forestry and got in, but is it really worth spending 3-4 additional years and quite a bit more money trying to obtain this degree? If I was to attend this program, I would graduate as a certified forester. I imagine this can only help jumpstart a career towards supervisory positions.

This summer will be my first summer on a fire crew for the Forest Service, and I plan on continuing down this career path several years after college. Could this forestry technician/wildland fire experience plus a B.S in Environmental Studies be enough to get a job in rangeland/forest/fire management for agencies such as USFS, BLM, Cal Fire, or ODF?",1614330913

36,environmental_science,"Aborism: An industry ripe for utility, and assisting biodiversity","I've recently entered the Aboriculture industry. It is an industry which initially i found very obtuse, stubborn, male dominated and monofocused.

Since the recent bushfires in Australia the experience of a rural Arborist has changed dramatically; where there was a greeting of birdsong of a morning, now there is the deafening wave of cicadas. The summer is hotter, and the trees are suffering - in turn - the danger rises and safety lowers.

As a newbie to this industry with an enthralling respect for the trade and with much life experience in business, and a deep love of the environment: i'm writing this post to start a discussion regarding the importance of highlighting it in our struggle to repair the damage done by recent and future climate events.

The impact, when utilised with efficacy and science, an aborists skills can have on local biodiversity is massive.

I'd love to see a discourse of the industry towards habitat relocation, a discussion on real regulation of land clearing.

 The counter argument is always profit and risk. I really believe there is both money and environmental prosperity available with the right minds, influence and 
Innovation.

47,environmental_science,Two questions regarding Natural Resources Management!,"Hi all, 

  I am looking at getting a Natural Resources Management AAS degree in forestry at my local community college, and want to make sure this is a good start. 

A little about me, I used to work as a wildfire technician before eventually getting sucked into the trades field between seasons. Now, I want to go back to school and get back put into the field. 

So, my school has an AAS degree in Natural Resources Management, that focuses on forestry in the second year. it is SAF accredited, and has a certification program for GIS. Would this be a good start to break into the field? They offer a NRM degree with a focus on fish/wildlife and park/recreation as well.

Second question: how is this field for someone with a family? Is it pretty similar to wildfire (long summers of seasonal work followed by job hunting in the off season)? Stability is my major concern right now, with raising kids. 

Thanks!",1612225427
48,environmental_science,At a crossroads in undergrad... stuck between biology and geology,"I'm only starting my undergrad education, but I know with certainty that I want a career in science. Specifically, I have two ideas in mind to continue studying into grad school: environmental science (specifically studying pollutants, soil, water quality), and toxicology (environmental or forensic). I know I could go into both with a Bsc in biochemistry, but my question is, would a background in geology be more helpful if I decide to study soil science, water quality, etc?

I see on a lot of posts and websites that a geology degree is generally better than biology (my university doesn't have a specific biochem degree, just a concentration) but I don't have a huge interest in many other topics in geology -- I only really want to go the environmental science route and be an environmental science technician. Would it be a real detriment if I decided to go the biochem route? I've done labs before, and I've had a little experience doing field work collecting samples. I enjoy both. 

I'm neither the most experienced science student nor the most eloquent writer, so thank you for reading. I appreciate any and all advice you could lend. I know this is probably a frequently asked series of questions, but I've had trouble finding the appropriate posts.",1612209968

57,environmental_science,"Promoted to ""Senior Environmental Technician"" in the UK and need advice on how to ask for a higher salary increase during my performance review","Hi all, as the title says I have been recently promoted to a “senior” role within my department. I have been working for this company for 18 months now and have a very good relationship with my manager and colleagues. However, I started this role straight after uni and just wanted to get my foot in the door of the industry, so I accepted a salary of 19k which then increased to 19.5k after 6 months. The salary range for that role is approximately 19-25k.

Before the Christmas break, my line manager made me aware of an upcoming promotion for my efforts and my work ethic. I then received a document to sign to confirm that I have now been officially promoted and that my salary has been increased to 21k per annum. I have my annual performance review in the next few days and would like some advice on how you would go about asking for a higher salary. I like my job but would like my pay to be more in line with the current market since I am doing tasks that are way above my current responsibilities and are more towards the tasks that PM’s usually do and have been doing so for the past 12 months. 

If the upper limit of the salary range for my previous role is 25k would it be reasonable to ask for 26k during my PDR. I know a 5k increase to their initial offer is quite a jump, but I don’t want to short sell myself as well as ask for so much that the offer gets thrown out of the window straight away.",1612084977

81,environmental_science,Connecting the Palestinian economy with Climate change solutions," **Peace Plan in which the Palestinians would have their currency added to the basket of currencies backing the IMF's Special Drawing Rights(SDR).**

*Another idea that could be appended to what has already been presented would be having the Palestinian currency pegged inversely to the value of oil.... along with its inclusion into the Special Drawing Rights. This would mean that any decision by the Palestinians to fire on Israel would become directly tied to the global economy and the value of the Palestinian currency. Since the threat of war in the Middle East is often followed by a rise in the demand and value of oil, any hostility from Gaza(as the epicenter of mid-east conflict) could effect the price of oil by raising its value, which would thus(in turn) lower the value of the Palestinian currency that's pegged inversely to it. This implies that aggression would have a direct negative implication to the Palestinian economy. In any event, the control over the printing or minting of this currency should be allotted to the Palestinian authorities. This way the peace process directly incentivizes the Palestinians not in terms of land, but in terms of global economic clout since their currency would be intricately tied to world peace and climate change solutions, thus putting some checks and balances on currencies whose value is directly tied to the value of oil and the war machine. The global movement that is trying to get away from war and pollution is something that would easily aid the global demand for this new Palestinian currency.*

Professionals having very busy career focused schedules/lives prompt different problems than other people such as less time to workout, prepare meals, etc. Or even the compounded stress of many responsibilities resulting in forming less than healthy habits.

If you are a professional that is trying to gain or lose weight, or has a friend who tells you about their struggles, honest answers are appreciated.

This is also true for subjects that are interesting in environmental; just because a subject exists academically doesn't mean there is a job for it. Examples include eco-psychology, many types of experimental sustainability practices, etc.

BUT if you are passionate about a particular issue, volunteer to create change. Start a small project locally yourself, or join someone else's. Support politicial campaigns and support legislation that aligns with causes you believe in. Raise awareness. Donate your time and/or money to environmental organizations. 

You very well may create more meaningful change in these ways than through an environmental job.

I am hoping to get some career advice since I am at a huge crossroads now. If anyone has the time, I will really appreciate it. I have a bachelor's degree in biology and am just about to finish my master's degree in ecology now. I am at the beginning of my career path, but have some experience that I gained doing temp jobs while I was studying.

I now have two job offers and no idea which one to take. The first one is a job in a very big, international pharmaceutical company known worldwide (and also based in a lot of different countries all over the world) and the main task is dealing with documentation regarding analytical procedures. The other one is at a research centre for microbiology, where I would be doing lab work as a lab technician. The job is available because one employee will be going on a maternity leave which is a year long in my country. This person doesn't have a university degree, just high school diploma, so I would be hired based on my high school diploma, not my bachelor's degree, meaning it's a very entry level job, so no fancy stuff, but I would gain knowledge on a couple of different lab methods (lab is mainly dealing with diagnosing viral infections). The pharmaceutical job is better paid, both are only for a year, but with the pharmaceutical job there is a much bigger chance of contract renewal. However that does not mean a lot to me, because I will be looking into moving out of the country in a year or so (has always been a dream of mine).

My question is, which job do you think has more value on my CV? Or which one would better help me get another biology or ecology related job? I obviously think it is the lab job, but since it's a very entry level job where I would only gain very basic lab skills, I am not so sure. Plus I kind of think I would have more doors open for me abroad with the pharmaceutical job (even though I am a biologist), but I really don't have much experience and don't know what to do.

I must say that I do not have any laboratory skills yet (apart from a couple month long temp job where I was dealing with water quality and water invertebrates) and I have worked for 10 months in that same pharmaceutical company before. I am based in Europe and will be moving to another EU country and I will try to find a job beforehand. I also don't speak any other EU languages apart from English and my native language, so I will have no knowledge of the language of the country that I will be moving into. That's why I was thinking maybe a job in another international pharmaceutical company would be easier to find in another EU country. I must say that I do not really enjoy working for a pharmaceutical company, it just seems like the more secure option to go with. But on the other hand, surely lab skills would help me get another job in ecology or biology?

Thank you so much in advance, I'm really lost right now.",1610376765

I also volunteered a lot with my parks department and recycling center over the summer if that’s important.  

I’ve looked into my works field sampling department frequently but there are never any open positions, and I would prefer to do field work that isn’t exclusively water and soil sampling. 

I just have a few questions: 

Is this environmental lab tech job hurting me more than it’s helping me career wise? 

I want to start applying for some Student Conservation Association post grad internships/crews to get field experience, but most of the good positions are in the summer. How bad would it look to leave my lab tech position only after 10-11 months to pursue this?

As you may guess I am not eligible for many, and the closest thing in design is Landscape Architecture which seems to be still firmly rooted in design. To make this move can anyone suggest what paths might be open to me- in terms of particular Masters programs/ unis that would accept candidates like me; or really any other ideas ...!

12,environmental_science,"Undergraduate student, currently conflicted about my degree choice and needing some guidance/advice.","Undergraduate student, almost finished with associates degree of sciences. I had planned on transferring to a university and pursuing an environmental science degree, as I really enjoy the subject matter and I would like a job where I am able to have a semi positive impact on the world. However, I had only recently done an in-depth look into the job opportunities and prospects and what I saw worried me. At this rate by the time I complete my bachelors degree will be when I'm 23, and I do not want to stay in school until I'm 25 finishing my masters. I want to have independence as soon as possible and be able to actually enjoy young adulthood. Jobs I've looked at locally have offered poor pay for bachelors, and looking at posts both old and recent on this subreddit, and other places I've had Science majors who got their bachelors describe the industry and being heavily unsatisfied with it, wishing they had just done something else instead.

I want a degree that will be able to get me decent jobs with a bachelors. So since I'm still in my associates program I'm looking at other potential degrees. However, so far something like a computer science degree or an engineering degree that flat out doesn't excite me. My advisors told me that I can at least take a programming 101 class this upcoming semester to explore other routes, but I am over whelmed by it all. People have told me that they were able to get other ""sciencey"" jobs by having a degree in science as a sort of fall back plan when they were not able to find/get hired for an environmental job. But I have no clue what that means.

That's how I feel right now anyways. I know that engineering can be used for environmental purposes, such as agricultural engineering but I'm also unsure how one even starts that process. I've seen a lot of talk about how what you studied in college affects so many things in the specific degree that is environmental science. I've tried talking to advising about but no one has really given me an answer for that.  

Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit for this. I'm feeling very stressed out and trying to figure this out asap.",1609919539

27,environmental_science,Ecology experts: question re: terminology,"I'm trying to wrap my head around the different terminology describing succession. Would love if an expert could tell me what I am getting confused here: 

**Recruitment** is sometimes used to describe how seedlings from one community are settled into an adjacent one. But sometimes I see the term '**dispersal**' describe the same thing. Are these terms different?

Similarly, I often see the term '**Establishment**' describe some sort of second stage coming after dispersal/recruitment, where a community has successfully made it's home in a new environment. However I cannot find an exact, falsifiable definition of this term (for example, what factors exactly would define when a new community is established?). 

I would love if someone could recommend a textbook or resource that puts all these terms into a proper framework. I've read various editions of 'community ecology' textbooks, but they don't seem to use the terms 'recruitment' or 'establishment' at all.

47,environmental_science,How challenging was it finding work in your field after graduating?,"I studied environmental studies with a focus in conservation science. The bulk of the classes I took were ecology courses. I also took a tropical biology field quarter in Costa Rica as part of my major where I did independent research. Most of my undergrad work in general is ecology and evolution focused but of course with an additional sociocultural perspective added that I appreciated having. I’m now also almost finished with an AS in GIS. The program I started out in at community college before transferring to university was a wildlife science program so I have coursework completed in that realm as well. 

I applied for dozens of field tech jobs as I was finishing undergrad to get my feet wet and build experience. Many of them didn’t even require an associates but I pretty much knew if I wanted to do field work this was the starting point. However I couldn’t even get an interview for any of these jobs. I’m working with a career coach now and I think we’ve made great strides on ensuring I’m marketing myself as well as possible but I’d already done quite a lot of work on my resume, cover letter, and LinkedIn prior. My coach even said there was polishing work to do but no major red flags as she looked over my materials. 

One organization in particular hires 3 interns a year and pays them just above minimum wage. No degree of any kind is required and my knowledge level was incredibly in line with the job description. I showed my enthusiasm in my cover letter and also followed up because I was so excited about it (they seemed annoyed by this which I sort of get, but if being proactive is considered a nuisance, how are you going to stand out?).

No interview and no follow up to let me know they’d pursued other candidates or anything. However I found a spotlight article on the interns they selected the year prior. They all had masters degrees. They only hired students with a graduate level education for an internship that didn’t require anything beyond a high school diploma. 

I get it, you want to go with the most qualified candidates, but I can’t help but be frustrated by this. You would hope an internship would give preference to students just starting out who most need that experience in their field. Right? I guess not.

Has anyone else had better luck and how did you position yourself? Do you have suggestions?

I am most interested in joining an environmental consulting company before I go to grad school in the future. I was just curious what advice professionals in the field would give to a student nearing graduation? 

More background information: 

\- excluding laboratory classwork, I have about a year of research in an environmental microbiology lab on campus 

\- I've done an externship with an environmental consulting firm in my home state (NJ) which was mostly shadowing and doing small projects during the winter 

\- my university offers continuing education classes that count for NJ LSRP CECs (continuing education credits) and I recently have taken one that also came with a certificate of completion (this was mostly for my own curiosity and I got a really good student discount for enrollment) 

\- I have also volunteered for a local garden where I help maintain the grounds and have extensive customer service experience both in foodservice and IT work since I currently work in my university's IT department 

Is there anything else I can do/should do to increase my chances of breaking into the industry? Any general advice is welcomed - for both professional work and future graduate studies in environmental science/engineering! 

I've seen one job say the 40 hr HAZWOPER OSHA training was preferred, but not required - would anyone recommend me to take this to increase my chances or is it not really worth it?

If you did a masters in environmental science or related field, why did you choose a thesis or non-thesis route?

\--

I have a BS in computational biology / bioinformatics, and I want to move into the environmental / conservational field. I'm currently finishing up a research project from when I was still an undergraduate. We're still working on this even after I've graduated. Honestly, I really just want to be done with this project, even though the motivation is supposed to be that we'll eventually publish a paper, but I feel like now I'm just doing it to look good on my resume and I hate that feeling.

In truth, I think I really want to do a non-thesis route because I want to take more classes and spend my time being involved with environmental groups around/in the campus. I can see myself researching on the web, and applying what others have researched. I don't know if it's just because I to be free of this previous project, or that I actually don't like conducting research. It might just be that I don't like this type of project, I'm not sure if I would feel differently if I collected my own data.

On top of this, I'm not sure who to ask for help because I don't want to be a burden. My PI has enough on their plate, and the graduate advisor for the grad school I'm applying to takes weeks to reply back. Talking to a therapist would be great, but I'm not sure where to find that has knowledge of doing STEM research. There's probably someone I can talk to (maybe current graduate students?), I think I'm just overwhelmed.

54,environmental_science,The Key Components of External Environment and its Impact," 

Before we talk about the impact of external environment on an  organization’s growth, it is crucial to know about the key controlling  components. Read through the following points to gain a broader  perspective regarding the same.

* Competition
* Consumer Tastes
* Technology
* Regulatory Environment
* Economic Environment

“*In the successful organization, no detail is too small to escape close attention.”*

* Lou Holtz, Coach

This  is undeniably one pragmatic quote on management and organization I have  come across in the recent days. When it comes to ensuring an organized  work flow and company growth, you cannot afford to overlook the  significance of detailing. This is where each of the key components of  the external environment in an organization’s growth comes into play.  Let’s delve deeper and explore the various contributing factors related  to mega-environment.

## Keeping track of the market trends is crucial 

Developing  an analytical understanding and catering to similar services are  crucial. Unless you are fully aware of the market trends and purchasing  behavior of your target audience, organizational growth shall always be  at stake. Entrepreneurs should always consider taking into account the  needs of the target consumers.

And in order to determine the same,  one must consider “competition” as one of the critical factors to  determine the functionality of the external environment. When an  individual has more knowledge about the market scenario, he/she can  ensure steady growth in a highly competitive field.

## Consumer’s taste plays a crucial role in an organization’s growth 

Next  up, is this critical aspect of consumer tastes which determine the  growth of an organization. Consumers can turn out to be fickle-minded,  and their tastes might vary from time to time. Thus, unless and until an  individual is investing enough time in determining this crucial factor,  ensuring success and business growth might be difficult.

For  example, if your organization deals with stationery products, you must  try and figure out all the latest advancements in the market. In case  you figure out a shift in the consumers’ taste for one of the stationary  products, draft a plan accordingly and choose to make necessary changes  in your product.

## An organization should be technologically advanced and well-knit 

A  company that aims to grow big and create maximum career opportunities  for potential job seekers must choose to revamp its technological  aspect.

***Impactjournals.us*** defines  technology as one of the most significant and central elements. This is  crucial to ensure efficient and seamless operations management within a  particular organization. Thus, in order to determine a seamless  organizational growth, you cannot do without focusing on the  technological structure of your organization.

You cannot take your  company to the zenith of success with the clients merely cling to  traditional devices. After all, it’s the era of video conferences and  screen sharing. Are you getting a drift of it?

**Regulatory Environment** 

The  regulatory environment of an organization determines the things you can  do and the ones you aren’t authorized to undertake. Thus, it is equally  important for an individual to keep the papers clean and continue with a  legitimate operation. Unless you are aware of the latest company laws  and regulatory norms, following the same might turn out to be a  challenge.

Aspiring entrepreneurs and the ones who are already a  part of the game should track all critical amendments from time to time.  You might choose to visit legal resources site such as the HG.org for a  detailed overview of the various aspects of corporate laws.

**Economic environment determines consumer optimism**

Economic  environment is a crucial factor that determines the income and  expenditure associated with the consumer’s lifestyle. Determining the  criticality of this context is important if you want your organization  to enjoy the perfect Return on Investment.

It will be much easier  for an individual to roll out new products and add relevant price tags,  if he/she knew the spending capacity of the majority of buyers. During  an economic downturn, an organization might consider producing  affordable products.

Consumers are the ones who determine the  success and failure of an organization. Introducing economically  advantageous services and products in hard times can change the game in a  good way. Even though business trend across the globe will keep  changing with each passing day, the significance of mega-environment and  its impact on organizations will prove to be the only constant.",1607438189

I'm thinking of going back to get a master's in either Environmental Engineering with an air quality concentration and an Environmental Assessment certificate or Chemical Engineering with all the electives being air quality engineering courses.

Scientists from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and international collaborators demonstrated a new method for mapping the location and size of trees growing outside of forests, discovering billions of trees in arid and semi-arid regions and laying the groundwork for more accurate global measurement of carbon storage on land.

Using powerful supercomputers and machine learning algorithms, the team mapped the crown diameter – the width of a tree when viewed from above – of more than 1.8 billion trees across an area of more than 500,000 square miles, or 1,300,000 square kilometers. The team mapped how tree crown diameter, coverage, and density varied depending on rainfall and land use. 

Mapping non-forest trees at this level of detail would take months or years with traditional analysis methods, the team said, compared to a few weeks for this study. The use of very high-resolution imagery and powerful artificial intelligence represents a technology breakthrough for mapping and measuring these trees. This study is intended to be the first in a series of papers whose goal is not only to map non-forest trees across a wide area, but also to calculate how much carbon they store – vital information for understanding the Earth’s carbon cycle and how it is changing over time.

**Measuring Carbon**

Carbon is one of the primary building blocks for all life on Earth, and this element circulates among the land, atmosphere, and oceans via the carbon cycle. Some natural processes and human activities release carbon into the atmosphere, while other processes draw it out of the atmosphere and store it on land or in the ocean. Trees and other green vegetation are carbon “sinks,” meaning they use carbon for growth and store it out of the atmosphere in their trunks, branches, leaves and roots. Human activities, like burning trees and fossil fuels or clearing forested land, release carbon into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, and rising concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are a main cause of climate change.

Conservation experts working to mitigate climate change and other environmental threats have targeted deforestation for years, but these efforts do not always include trees that grow outside forests, said Compton Tucker, senior biospheric scientist in the Earth Sciences Division at NASA Goddard. Not only could these trees be significant carbon sinks, but they also contribute to the ecosystems and economies of nearby human, animal and plant populations. However, many current methods for studying trees’ carbon content only include forests, not trees that grow individually or in small clusters.

Tucker and his NASA colleagues, together with an international team, used commercial satellite images from DigitalGlobe, which were high-resolution enough to spot individual trees and measure their crown size. The images came from the commercial QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites. The team focused on the dryland regions – areas that receive less precipitation than what evaporates from plants each year – including the arid south side of the Sahara Desert, which stretches through the semi-arid Sahel Zone and into the humid sub-tropics of West Africa. By studying a variety of landscapes from few trees to nearly forested conditions, the team trained their computing algorithms to recognize trees across diverse terrain types, from deserts in the north to tree savannas in the south.",1606229681

31,environmental_science,2020 WOTUS Rule Question,"Hello Reddit friends. I was hoping to get some help with a question regarding the new 2020 WOTUS ruling. 

I have a client with an ephemeral drainage going through his livestock ranch property he is wanting to develop a small subdivision on. The ephemeral drainage only has water in it in response to precipitation events. The one exception is there is a stock tank within that ephemeral drainage, and the volume of water/ surface area of the stock tank constantly changes over time. It's really small or non-existent during drought, small during the winter, larger during the spring, smaller during dry summers, etc.. The upstream fringe of the water in the livestock tank seems to always have wetland vegetation for an \~30' buffer. When the tank shrinks, so does the wetland vegetation. As the tank fills and backs up, the wetland vegetation also shifts with it. 

My question is, if the ephemeral drainage and stock tank are not considered jurisdictional WOTUS under the new 2020 rule, would that ever-shifting wetland space be considered WOTUS for EPA/USACE permitting purposes? He doesn't want to fill in the stock tank, but wants to shore up the sides a little to make it a detention pond. 

I appreciate any feedback. I still haven't worked much with the new 2020 WOTUS rule. Thanks!",1605922266

39,environmental_science,Disadvantages Of Green House Effect," 

* Since green house gases helps to maintain the temperature, the  primary effect of the increase in greenhouse gases would be on climate.  This would mean warmer summers with natural disasters. Hurricanes have  become common in recent years.
* Water level balance of the earth  would be destroyed. Polar ice caps would melt leading to an increase in  the ocean level. Floods will inundate low lying areas.
* Marine  life and ecosystem would be destroyed. Oceans absorb carbon dioxide  thereby affecting the level of alkalinity. Many forms of marine life  would be adversely affected if alkalinity increases. Polar ecosystems  would be destroyed. In the Arctic, melting polar caps are threatening  the habitats of polar bears and penguins.
* Global warming would  also affect the weather pattern. Rainfall would become erratic in many  parts of the world. This might eventually lead to desertification.
* The  effect on human and economic life would also be tremendous. It is  estimated that the rise in temperature would reduce global output by 2  to 3 percent. This cost would run into trillions of dollars. As  agricultural production is affected, this might lead to frequent famines  and famine related diseases.

Here are the alarming effects of greenhouse that are taking a toll on  our planet for the past many years. Read through the points below and  figure out the remedial measures that can keep such calamities under  control. 

### Global Warming 

Global warming is by far the greatest disadvantage of the greenhouse  effect. A rise in the level of the greenhouse temperature directly  contributes to the rising temperature of the planet. As the greenhouse  gases tend to increase, their ability to trap the heat and radiate it  back to the earth’s surface also increases. This, as a result, gives  rise to the phenomenon called global warming. 

**Remedial Measures:** Here are a few effective steps that can be followed in order to tackle the negative effects of global warming. 

* The government must take stronger initiatives in order to prevent deforestation by all means. 
* Saving rainforest should be the topmost priority for us. 
* Focus on recycling reusable products more with each passing day. 
* Use less hot water since the process takes a lot of energy to heat water. 
* Plant a tree every week and embrace the habit of switching off all electronic devices while not in use. 
* Move  your thermostat down by 2 degrees during winter and up by 2 degrees in  summer. This will help you save about 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide  every year. 

### Catastrophic impact on marine life 

This is yet another alarming and definitely one sad scenario we have  to face these days due to the ill effect of greenhouse gases. It is a  known fact that ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and maintain alkalinity  level. However, in recent days, the rate at which the level of carbon  dioxide is increasing due to the greenhouse effect, marine life is  certainly at risk. 

**Remedial Measures:** Take note of the following practices in order to save marine life. 

* We should learn how to make safe seafood choices. 
* People must be more responsible for the usage of plastic products. 
* We must also learn how to take care of beaches and make them more sustainable for marine life. 
* Say no to the purchase of items that includes materials exploiting marine life. 

### Significant increase in water levels above the safe mark

Talking of the negative impacts of greenhouse effects, this is one  point that needs to be mentioned and talked about in detail. As the  average temperature of the earth is steadily increasing due to the  impact of greenhouse gases, the polar ice caps are rapidly melting down.  This is gradually marking a significant increase in the water levels  above the safe marks. 

**Remedial Measures:** We need to abide by the suggestions below in order to take control of the increase in water levels. 

* Protect wetlands and take more initiatives to plant more trees. 
* We must also focus on constructing buildings that are above sea levels. 
* Tackle climate change and work collaboratively with the government in order to introduce better flood prevention system. 

Now that you are aware of the major disadvantages of greenhouse  effects which are taking a toll on the earth’s ecosystem and sustainable  living, re-read the blog carefully. You need to sit back and think over  the context of the discussion.",1605794604

Background: 

-Employment: I'm a current DoD Employee (GS12) and I have veterans preference for federal hiring. I work as a systems manager/training manager for an Air Force base as an 1102 (Contracting/Procurement). 

-Education: I have dual BS degrees in History and Political Science, with a focus in policy. They're over a decade old at this point, though, and I've been out of the disciplines for a long time. No background in hard sciences. Everything in my job has been toward finance. 

-Job I want: I want a job with the EPA, Department of Agriculture, US Park Service, etc. A federal agency that deals with environmental enforcement. I love hiking and I usually spend a few weeks out in my local national parks a year doing landscape or wildlife photography. I love it. 

-What I can do, education-wise: I have a full ride to a public college for three full academic years (GI Bill). I'm old (mid 30s) so I don't think anyone will waste scholarship money on me beyond that. I can go to any public college I can get into. My choices are limited as to who will take a multiple-degree student. 

-Original Plan: Go to the University of Mass Boston (got accepted) and burn through an undergrad in Environmental Sciences Professional, PSM in a year. Can be done, did the math with my advisor. Then transition that into an Environmental Science degree at the same university. As to jobs after that, just... hope I get more of an idea once I'm in program.

You see what the problem is. I have no experience as to what types of jobs would be available for that education + my prior work experience and I would love some ideas from you guys. Really, my plans are entirely open-ended at this point as I wouldn't start until either the Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 semesters wherever I end up.

50,environmental_science,Help Picking Major!,"Okay so I'm a senior in high school applying to college and I have 3 major's I'm interested in but don't know which to pick. I don't know if I would actually do well in each but I will explain why they interest me below. I do well in all subjects (90 average), but I haven't taken a serious science course that can determine my strengths in it. Even though I do well, I'm also a very lazy person. I work 100x better when it's something I really enjoy. Each major has a school specified for it and I want to try and stay away from transferring if I could. I just want some input on how I should make a decision or if you work/worked in the field to give me advice.

1. Marketing. I am a creative who loves coming up with ideas especially when working with others for school projects etc. There is a lot of flexibility which I like, and many different paths I can take. I love fashion so I can find a fashion company to work for and living in NYC is an advantage. I like having some control over what I can do and marketing allows me to do that. And even if I don't do fashion, I can possibly work for an environmental company.
2. Environmental Science/ Engineering. I'm a big advocate for the environment. I want to do everything I can to help here in NYC. I don't know much about the job itself but all I know is that I am interested in everything environmental related whether its animals, nature, sustainability, etc. I'm just worried about job aspects even though rates are growing quick in this field.
3. Nursing, more specifically a nurse in dermatology. I am always watching videos and reading articles about skin, hair, nails and what I can do for myself and it gets me very motivated. I even try to help others when I can. I've watched Dr. Pimple Popper and I don't get grossed out by anything so that's nothing to worry about. I was considering med school to become a dermatologist but I know I wouldn't enjoy it or be motivated enough to succeed in it. Nursing also has great security which is a big plus.

I would say that I'm not extremely passionate about environmental governance in general, and I'm struggling to come up with interesting topics to write on. To those of you studying or interested in the environment and environmental governance, are there any topics you might suggest? Below is a direct quote from the assignment. I'm also stressed about the length requirement of the paper and there being enough existing literature surrounding the topic to write such a long paper on it. Thank you in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

 Your original piece of research will be designed to answer a “why” question about the emergence of particular outcomes related to the development or impact of environmental governance around the world. In other words, why does that outcome vary (or what factors lead to its variation) in different conditions. The research should compare your outcome of interest for at least two observations (countries, cities, time periods, topic areas, etc.). This study should demonstrate how it builds upon and advances existing scholarship in your area of interest.",1604359661

I am working on a project for our company where we will replace all our disposable palstic with reusable, durable plastic. 

As part of the business case I would like to have an overview showing the Co2 impact of our current disposable plastics, and compare it with the new reusables.

I have the measures (oz) of our current containers. Is there a ""simple"" way to calculate the Co2 impact of the plastic? It doesn't have to be super accurate, but rather just give a fairly good overview over the benefit of switching to reusables, from throwing away disposables every day.

64,environmental_science,Undergraduate dissertation advice?,"(University) Advice about the structure of my natural science dissertation?

I am an environmental science student in my final year of my BSc. my dissertation is about a local peat bog. It touches on general conservation of the bog but is mainly focussed on a species of flower, bog asphodel (N. ossifragum), which is popular with the local community who essentially demanded it be part of the management plant for the bog. My paper aims to determine whether the efforts to increase/conserve the number of asphodel is having a negative impact on other bog vegetation species, as well as discussing whether the correct indicators have been chosen, and finally touching upon suggestions that could improve the management plan.

I havent collected any primary data of my own. However, I have been provided the *exact* data I need by the organisation that manage the bog. it has everything I need, all the numbers regarding bog ashpodel, bog mosses and other species. The organisation are aware of my dissertation, and my dissertation supervisor regularly works with this organisation, so essentially my project was suggested with this exact data in mind. My dissertation supervisor made it clear that I wouldn’t need to collect primary data of my own.

What wasn't made clear to me by my supervior, who now unfortunately isn't replying to my emails, is how I would write my ""methodology"" and ""results"" sections. Usually with a dissertation based only on secondary data, you would discuss in your methodology how you chose which secondary sources you selected, why they were better than other sources, and how they might not be entirely appropriate for your own study. Obviously, this is not applicable to me; I haven't had to choose between multiple sources, and my secondary data *is* entirely appropriate for my study. How then should I go about writing my methodology ? Should I just discuss their methods of collecting data, and why they chose them? This part feels to me like it is bordering on some kind of academic misconduct. The same question goes for my ""results"" section. I have complied their results into something smaller and more concise, combining and comparing sets of data that weren’t originally displayed together, but is this valid to present in my results section? Or would this also count as trying to pass their results for my own? Everything is referenced accordingly",1602558402

35,environmental_science,PSA for Young environmental consultants,"I just want to give some voice-of-experience advise to young environmental consultants to wear VOC respirators when you're around excavations or otherwise somewhere exposed to VOCs.  You may not feel like it's needed.  You might just be hopping down in an excavation real quick to collect a soil sample or just standing there taking notes, or drilling, or...It might look or feel silly in the situation you find yourself.  But please trust this voice of experience, protect yourself with proper PPE.  Take that HAZWOPER class seriously. It does not serve you well to tough it out for whatever reason you tell yourself that it's not necessary. If a half-mask respirator isn't really needed, a P-95 works really well for a lot of situations if you have a good seal.

I'm a 40 y/o environmental geologist with 14 years of experience in soil &amp; groundwater remediation, mainly petroleum releases.  I have developed some pretty serious lung disease that I think is the result of VOC exposure over the years.  I started having minor asthma-type breathing issues a few years after starting as geological technician - about the time I got my PG license.  I frequently see people brush off wearing PPE when I work sites with other PGs or PEs, or just driving down the road and see a crew working at a random site.  I wear PPE **ALL** the time now, but previously I only used a respirator in confined spaces or when it's really, truly obviously necessary.  I would bet most consultants don't wear PPE for something like a heating oil UST remediation project.  Anyway, that's all.  I'm too young to be having such serious lung issues.  I'd rather you learn something from my life lesson.  If you smell VOCs at a site, protect yourself.  That's all.",1601413253

After further research, I began learning that most benzene ""poisoning"" cases are near petroleum tanks, petrol production, forest fires etc. and that there was massive benzene contamination from the Aliso Canyon gas blow out a few years back that exposed many people to extreme amounts of benzene.

I feel as if this is never talked about significantly by the environmental science community when discussing fossil fuel pollution/ climate change. Any thoughts? I'm just a noob so that could explain my ignorance of the topic.

here's a study I found on urban benzene pollution: *'Assessing Health Risk from Benzene Pollution in an Urban Area'* [https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1020691506835](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1020691506835)",1601069625

My research has been on nanotechnology/photonics, basically building fancy lasers. The work itself is really cool, but more and more I find I'm not very passionate about the applications. I think I want to work on something more along the lines of fighting climate change or improving sustainability. The problem is, I feel like a complete noob in that area. I'm curious what some of the important research directions are, and where my skills could be useful.  


Given my photonics background, I guess the obvious thing would be solar energy. But I wonder if there are other opportunities. I've wondered about researching sustainable materials -- in photonics we use a lot of heavy metals like Ga, In, As, Sb, and it would be cool to work on replacing those with more abundant elements. But again, I feel lost trying to figure out what research is being done there, because I'm almost starting from scratch.

It's something I'd like to verify each member of (though everyone's company would be anonymous; verify through name, random field photo with you in it, and a company website where you're shown as one of the scientists). 

We can move it to another app for ease of discussion, but just an area to discuss success and fail of various novel techniques (leave the standards for what they are.. unless you're vocal against a certain SOP for your state/district/area, lulz). The SER (Society of Ecological Restoration) forum should be available, along with whatever messaging apps (WhatsApp, Hangouts, etc.) that people would prefer. 

Remember when you did a proper delineation class or took continuing education (CE) credits? That ish was fire getting to talk shop with everyone. Let's do that, and be just as professional as when we run into a random person on a field day, deep in the swamp. 

The UN has charged 2021-2030 as the decade of environmental restoration. I'm happy to be in it. We all know there's lots of challenges that have very little (or no) research related.

58,environmental_science,B.A. in Environmental Science and Policy—Will a B.A. limit my job prospects?,"I'm currently in community college switching from a biology major to an environmental science major. For money reasons, I'm pretty dead-set on going to one specific school that only offers a B.A. in Environmental Science and Policy as the only env. science degree available. In terms of electives, I plan on taking as many science courses (as opposed to policy courses) as possible. The program includes internships and I could possibly get research experience. I could also minor in biology at this school. 

My concern is whether or not a B.A. will hurt my career chances. The degree is an environmental *science* (not *studies*) degree but it's a B.A., not a B.S. How much of that matters to employers? Will minoring in biology help? If it matters, I have already taken a semester of calculus, a semester of statistics, a year of biology, a year of general chemistry, and one semester of ochem, so I do have hard science and lab experience.

63,environmental_science,Right to repair in the environmental community.,"I generally don't like to throw things out and use things for as long as possible because 

1. I'm cheap and don't want unnecessary spending
2. I get attached to my tools and belongings that have served a good purpose in my life
3. I don't want to create waste.

Although I'm not handy and don't enjoy tinkering or fixing things, I still try because my desire not to throw things out is usually greater. Because of this, I've been looking and googling a lot of ""how to fix \_\_\_"", and came across the ""right to repair"" movement.

I feel like the environmental or sustainability community should be on board and in support with this movement as well, and I'm curious to  know whether there are environmental or sustanability organizations that do support this. Because if we don't have products and systems in place that lets us repair our daily use tools like smartphones, but encourage us to throw them frequently, that doesn't help the environment at all, and hurts the communities as well. I've recently found out about thinkpads and other used business laptop communities in which old devices are almost sought after, customizing and upgrading your cheap used devices is ""cool"", and reusing and refurbishing retired device is the default. I also foundout about fairphones, which is a smartphone company that makes sure their parts and the labors are manufactured as fairly as possible and their products can be easily repaired and fixed by simple tools by the even the not so technologically gifted (i.e. me).

Shouldn't the environmental community and sustainability communities support this? Having repair shops or services that can easily repair people's devices without much hassle. Having resources and information available from manufacturers so people can easily replace simple parts (like battery) and not have to just get a new one. Encouraging product design so more products are durable and various parts can be replaced or upgraded so people can customize based on their needs. Buying used or refurbished is encouraged and considered ""smart"" because they're more affordable yet equally or even more funcional. I feel like all of this is only beneficial to sustainability and environmental protection both from resource conservation perspective and prevention of environmental contamination. 

I've worked at community electronic recyling and reuse places, have worked with small environmental organizations, but I feel like this hasn't really come up in the environmental community. Is this something that the environmental organizations or communities are aware of and support? Because if it's not, I feel that it should be.",1600641895

I'm a freshman in college, so this year is literally my first experience with college stuff.

I had been assuming, until starting this course, that an Environmental Science major is more about the larger environment and that a Biology major would be more suited to these cell courses.

With a group of approximately 100 people we are cleaning a river. We are all volunteers, and it is incredible the amount of rubbish of all kinds that is taken out, but especially plastic.

&amp;#x200B;

We want to find a recyclable destination for this plastic, but the bottles are really dirty. They have algae that are very difficult to clean, a lot of impregnated mud, and even some bottles that we found had fuel in them.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, a lot of the plastic that we collect, we clean it with water from the river itself, and we leave it drying so that it is in better conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

The companies to which we take this waste, do not accept it because they tell us that it is very dirty and that it can affect the machinery.

&amp;#x200B;

We are out of ideas, if anyone can give us some advice, or some experience on what to do with this waste I would be very grateful.

16,environmental_science,My research mentor hated me so much I dropped my thesis,"I was planning on completing my honors thesis on agricultural human labor abuses, but my research mentor, who was also my food systems professor, made me switch my topic to animal agriculture after I told her I was vegan. For some reason my diet really offended her and she stopped mentoring me after that (this was the second week of classes). There were multiple times she started angrily crying *at* me multiple times after class after that, and then aggressively act like I had complained about it. She would also ""forget"" I had appointments for office hours and refuse to see me, get super tense during lecture and just get all up in my face during lecture (I was sitting in the first row, so it was more like her hips were in my face). She also ""misplaced"" my grading sheets on multiple occasions and seemed to keep trying to instigate a response from me. She tried to fail me when at the end of the semester when I was in the hospital recovering from a near-death car accident, claiming I'd never talked to her about what I was working on. At the time, I didn't really think much of it, and I didn't even connect the question about my diet to her later actions until after I graduated. I went to a school of over 35,000 students where the counselors and advisors all had three month waiting lists for appointments, so I didn't think it was something worth talking to them about. Instead, I opted to not continue with my research the following semester, since it wasn't a requirement for graduation and I had just one semester left

I really regret not talking to admin about this and not trying to get a new mentor! I ended up learning so much about the topic (specifically, environmental health impacts from animal agriculture) and had a strong draft of 30 pages done. I feel REALLY SAD about not submitting my article to journals. I want to share what I learned with others. I don't have enough self confidence to be able to complete it on my own (I've tried multiple times but I get too overwhelmed with anxiety). It was so disheartening. I really need a mentor for moral support.

Advice or propositions for mentorship, anyone?

I graduated with a BS in Environmental Science in June, got lucky and started as an intern for a small consulting firm the same month. I basically help out wherever I’m needed between the habitat restoration and biological monitoring departments so I’ve gotten a good mix of office and field experience. Overall a good gig and my coworkers are helpful and kind. I was hired under the impression that eventually I could be given a permanent role, I’m not sure when or how that would happen though.

The issue: I had just moved before getting the position so I have about a 40 minute commute every day and I drive back and forth between the field and the office quite a bit and last month I ended up spending $300 on gas. I only make $14.50 and hour and don’t love what I’m doing enough to be happy with taking home paychecks under $500 every week.

I don’t really plan to stay in consulting for the long haul and want to go back to school and get a PhD anyways so is it worth saying in the industry and barely getting by for now? I’ve been looking for other jobs that are closer to my house and require more science/lab work but there’s obviously not many entry level openings due to covid. I wouldn’t risk up and quitting in a time like this but should I at least tell my boss that I’m spending so much money on gas? Would they even care?

I have an opportunity to get a MS in natural resources from UW-stevens point and participate in soil organic carbon research. I would be working with the NRCS and farmers/foresters/etc to develop a multi-faceted toolkit for the state of WI to determine soil carbon in the field. We would be assisting with developing provisional ecological site descriptions for the NRCS throughout the state of WI. We would be teaching farmers and NRCS scientists how to use this toolkit at the end of the research project. There are also opportunities to hybridize my curriculum with wetland science/restoration courses - which is where my primary interests lie. The problem is that the next two years of funding have NOT dispersed yet, and yet the professor is looking for someone to get started on the project this fall (so VERY soon), which I don't know if I feel comfortable with that.

I think I could enjoy a really enjoy a career with the NRCS or a soil/water conservation society if I go down that road. I know I have a big interest in agriculture but I do want to make sure that a graduate degree specializing in soil science will give me the ability to work in higher roles in restoration (wetland specialist, conservation/restoration planner, etc) as this is where the core of my passion lies. My ideal job would to be to work as a regulator/scientist in wetland mgmt/restoration and to marry my nature/landscape photography that I capture while in the field as a side business to it. If I could also use my free time to start up a small native plant nursery and sell plants/seed mix this would be the most ideal way for me to make a difference, fuel my creativity/intellectual capacity and make a comfortable income.

What do you guys think of my ideas and goals with all of this being said? Can a person specializing in soil science offer their skills to restoration ecology and wetland science to a great extent? What about funding - is it a big risk to go move and start taking classes if there isn't a confirmation the USDA/NRCS grant has not been dispersed yet? Should I be looking more closely wetland/watershed science degrees or perhaps botany/restoration ecology degrees? Any other suggestions? Thanks!!",1598377900

My friends and I put together a video looking at how and why bees are dying (generally) around the world and what we can do about it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CZJr0nri54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CZJr0nri54) 

We're trying to use YouTube to educate people about sustainability and this is our most recent topic. We've seen massive declines in honey bee populations over the last few decades, yet a 300% increase in demand for bee pollination in food production. Bees are essential in 35% of food production and enhance the growth of 90% of the 107 most consumed crops. Yet, poor farming practices such as over subsidising monocultures, rampant pesticide usage and removal of cover crops has lead to over 90% loss of bee colonies in some nations. This is due to several effects including hive health, parasitic mites, poor variety of pollens available, greater distances between flowers and death/confusion caused by insecticides such as neonicotinoids. This is further exacerbated by pollution which both changes the flowering patterns of plants due to climate change (which bees rely on to determine foraging and breading times) and obscures scent molecules emitted by flowering plants. 

There are however a few simple things we can do to help bee colonies, such as planting a variety wild flowers on our balconies and in our gardens, buying sustainable honey and working with scientists, farmers and governments to encourage better farming practices.

I was originally enrolled to pursue Env Engineering, but had some doubts about the higher level math and upper level coursework, so I switched to Env Sci.

My goals, though currently vague, are to either work in developing/improving renewable energy technology (such as solid state battery storage for solar), or help develop and research sustainability methods of all kinds. 

I'm just not sure if engineering is the path for me, so I'm kinda lost at this point. Any suggestions or opinions from folks who have gone the EE route would be helpful, as well as what all potential there is with just the Env Sci degree. Thanks.",1597422530

94,environmental_science,Gaining Experience in the Field?,"After struggling for years trying to get my associates degree in veterinary medicine, I decided it wasn't for me and I've decided to switch my major to environmental science. Unfortunately, where I currently live there are only two colleges nearby and neither of them offer any degrees I have any sort of interest in so I'm getting my degree online. Due to the amount of college I already have under my belt I'm a little less than halfway to a bachelors degree. 

From what I've read, this career, like most, requires a lot of volunteer and hands on experience. I have been in the veterinary field for years and have plenty of experience dealing with animals but I know environmental science goes beyond that. My problem is...now that I'm 25 I'm currently working a full time job as a veterinary lab technician making $15 an hour and have a baby on the way. Due to rent, bills, medical expenses ect. I cannot afford to work for free right now and my free time is very limited. 

My end goal is to become a park ranger or work as a conservation officer or some sort of educator within the parks department. I am interested in eventually getting my masters. But it sounds like no matter what amount of formal education you have, without dedicating hours of free labor, finding a job in this field is next to impossible. It has me really discouraged. I've never had trouble balancing work, online classes and other responsibilities... but I simply cannot afford to work for free.

At some point in my career, I was wondering if it would be feasible to start a land management company. I am obviously no pro in this subject, as I am a recent grad, but here is a list of some of the things that I would be passionate about doing for land owners.

\- Sustainability consulting: (maybe stuff like re-grading for better water drainage, soil quality improvement, water sampling and monitoring, etc.)

\- Minor environmental consulting: (Not sure how this would work, but maybe helping small land owners meet environmental standards on land they want to sell?)

\- Ecological assessments: (maybe land and animal surveying for land owners who use their land for hunting).

\- Creating maps in GIS systems like ArcMap for land owners and just general consulting purposes. 

\- Flipping land for banks that are buying land to sell. 

\- Just being a general contractor for minor land development projects (I already do this sort of). 

Okay, so obviously, there is a lot here, and I don't know if any of this is actually profitable or feasible, but I think this would be a pretty cool thing to do, and something that really interests me. So, what do you guys think, is this even a feasible idea? Do businesses like this exist?

58,environmental_science,help choosing major,"Hi Reddit! I know this probably gets asked a lot in this sub but I’m having a really difficult time deciding between two majors at my university and I was wondering if I could get some advice.

I’m a student at Michigan State University and there are two majors I’m stuck between choosing, Environmental Studies&amp;Sustainability and Fisheries and Wildlife with a concentration in conservation biology. I wanted to major in something environment-related because I feel strongly about the state of the environment and our impact on it and what we can do to protect it, so that was what originally drew me to the Environment&amp;Sustainability major. However, that being said, I’ve done some reading on what jobs you can get with sustainability degrees and a lot of them I’m unsure I would be interested in working in some of them. 

I’m really interested in working for places like the DNR or something natural resource related, and from job descriptions that I read a lot of the positions had requirements in biology (or other similar subjects) degrees. I also like animals and I liked my biology classes in high school, so that’s what’s interesting me in changing to F&amp;W. The conservation concentration also is something that interests me because I feel passionate about maintaining balance in nature and I want to do my part in that. However, I don’t know if I want to do specific research in a specialized area like a lot of biologists do, especially since I’m most likely planning on going to grad school regardless of what I decided to major in. I also want to have options when it comes to job prospects (I know that’s a bit wishy washy) and I’m worried getting too specific with my studies will hurt me in that area.

I think I’m leaning more towards FW, but if I did that would it also be possible for me to study sustainability in grad school with an undergrad biology degree?

I’m also a strong writer and I have a background in language classes and anthropology. I’m also going to get GIS training sometime in the next year. I want to work in nature but I also want to work with people too. I’m sorry if this is sounding like a job resume lol but I just want to paint as much of a picture as I can for reference.

I could pursue a double major in biology and environmental studies, and do an extra semester (so graduate in 3.5 years). Should I do that, and not go to grad school?

I'm going into my senior year of college studying finance and am starting to programming language journeys. I honestly don't have a solid plan for my future, but I do have this strong feeling that I would want to pursue something in data analytics

I know this isn't a lot of information but if anybody has an experience, stories, advice, or resources for doing something like this it would be greatly appreciated. Also taking any graduate program recommendations, scholarships, ***absolutely anything!***

**Some examples of questions I have:**

* What do you do on a day-to-day basis?
* What are the most valuable programming languages that you utilize in your field?
* How much of your career is interacting with people? Is it true that data analytics is usually back-office?
* What is the most rewarding thing about what you do?
* Is pursuing an MS on your dime a smart move, or should you wait until your employee pays for it?
* Do you feel fulfilled in what you do?

* The pH of the water that's mostly influenced the rain
* The amount of dissolved oxygen 
* Amount of nitrates in the water
* Temperature 
* Deforestation

I'm hoping to start my journey as an environmental scientist (MS/PhD) in 2021 and would like some advice on research areas that might suit me best. Unfortunately, my undergrad was in another subject, and I don't have a great grasp of current state of the literature (reading suggestions welcome!). I'd like to focus on something that would be high impact. I have tried to find this by scouring forums, poking around in literature (though obviously scope is wide), checking out [IPCC's Synthesis Reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf) (and special reports), and scanning faculty web pages, but would love your opinions as well.

My background is in computer science, minored in math and physics (graduated 2016). I worked for a top tech company for several years.

I have heard that focusing on cities may be a good idea, such as urban resilience. I am also interested in the ocean and deforestation (just personal interest here, but obviously that matters ;) ).

At the end of the day, I would like to get a job in fieldwork. I'm not sure if a degree will prepare me to do this. A degree seems to be more ""book knowledge"" and critical thinking than actual practical skills, and I'm failing to see the benefit. Diploma programs in the area seem to be strongly based on learning skills: 2 classes on GIS, another on water assessments ext. I've looked at job postings (I'm based in Canada) and they all say something along the lines of wanting ""a degree or diploma in environmental studies, ecology, or related field"" has an education requirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm leaning towards a degree because I nearly have it. But I've heard that many people with degrees struggle to find work and end up going for even more schooling. So is a higher level of schooling beneficial or is a program that is tailored to skills something employers want?

The EPA listed the oxygen, phosphorus and sediment as reasons for the impairment status. The city has almost completed construction on a water plant along the creek. Is there anything I can do to improve the creek or should I wait and see how it tests after the treatment plant is running? I would assume the plant would test the creek they're dumping water into right? I'm unfortunately unable to find much information on the plant. The only reason I know it's being built is I've hiked the trail myself and seen it being constructed. I would like to improve it as I have noticed a decline over the years in fish population and the creek is often too murky to see the bottom.

14,environmental_science,"Water Resources PSM, or International Policy MS","I would really like to work in hydrology, using GIS and data science. I would prefer to work on international water issues if at all possible, but I have a few issues to work out and choices to make.

Tl;dr: torn between Water Resource Management PSM at OSU and International Environmental Policy MS at JHU

I'm currently graduating with a BS in Environmental Science with a specialization in Applied Ecology, through Oregon State University. I planned to continue on to the PSM, Professional Science Masters, in Water Resource Management, while completing a data science certificate at Berkeley, possibly a GIS certificate through UC San Diego, and possibly a Water Conflict Management certificate at OSU as well. I know that's a lot or 'too much' to most people, but I'm just one of those lifelong learner types and I don't really care about that.

I thought consulting while finishing the masters would be the best route, however I would really love to get involved in international projects, for example with UN Water, using GIS and data science, or even possibly see if I could join the Lawrence Berkeley lab. Johns Hopkins offers an MS in Environmental Science and Policy, with a track in International Environmental Policy, and a GIS certificate can be included.

A few concerns I have: I don't want to live in Washington DC, the cost of living in California can limit realistic career opportunities, JHU is a little bit more expensive but does include the GIS cert too, JHU is overall ranked higher but OSU has a good reputation on the West Coast and more networks there and they are very similarly ranked in their environmental science programs, policy jobs seem to often pay less and are in less demand than hydrology jobs, I'm not sure if the PSM or the MS is more worth it, and I might like to apply for Berkeley's ESPM PhD some day.

I'm feeling torn between settling for what seems like the more practical option of the Water Resource Management PSM and building consulting experience (which I fear might pigeonhole me into a career that's okay but not quite what I truly want to do), and gaining experience in GIS (which pays much less initially and takes longer to go up in pay), and banking on policy jobs which might require relocation, less pay, potentially 'too much' international travel (eg. if I settle down and start a family), etc, but it is what I'd really love to do.

I'm currently an Engineer (6 years) working for a defense contractor with a BS in Physics.

I decided to pursue a masters in environmental science (Johns Hopkins) to try to move my career in an area that I find more interesting. The program I'm interested in has the benefit of being able to do all the classes online (except for one week long intensive field course). This program also has the option to take a few extra classes and get a certificate in GIS, which after some research, looks really interesting and might meld well with my model/sim/analysis background.

I'm hoping to get some feedback on my background so I can narrow my search to jobs that may be a good fit. I'm hoping to use this to better prepare for future job possibilities.

Would my background in physics, engineering work experience (Modeling/sim/analysis), and a masters in environmental science be a good fit for finding a job in the field?

54,environmental_science,"Is it worth it for someone in my position to continue perusing this degree, or should I seek out alternatives","Hey all. So unfortunately I wasted a lot of my teens/early 20s and am currently less than half way through completely my degree at 26. Initially I was going to major in biology with a ecology focus, but I made the decision to switch to either environmental science or rangeland science (the coursework is the same at this stage) since they have fewer prerequisites and seem to make one eligible for similar jobs.

My problem is this; I have no experience in this field. Even volunteering to get eligible experience is hard (I hope to change this once Covid regulations are lifted and places with be taking volunteers again). Entry level jobs are extraordinarily rare, and still ask for more coursework than I currently have. I also fear that, because I have to dedicate so much to working, I won’t have time to get the most out my education and pursue developing my skills. I’m also worried that I’m ineligible for a lot of opportunities due to my age (calcorps is off the table, for instance).

I’m really not trying to give out a sob story, I know many can relate, but I’m not sure how I can compete with 22 year olds that were able to pursue internships and such. I’d really hate for all of this work to leave me nothing to show for it.

So, should I continue, or consider other options? If so, are their somewhat similar degrees that are more employable?",1593748063

I've been thinking about this for a while now and I'd really love to hear some different opinions.  
First, a small heads up:  
Although I will use left and right to indicate a general political direction, I see how this generalizing of political views can be harmful to a sensible discussion about politics.  
I will however keep using these terms for sake of simplicity.  


The more I'm learning about climate change, other environmental problems, and politics, the more I come to the conclusion that the approach that a lot of radical left environmentalists use is actually doing more harm than good in the debate and approach to climate change.  
There are many people that have come to see climate change as an idea of hippies and oversensitive leftists, which obviously doesn't contribute to sensible discussions about the environment.  
I see this as a result of some radical environmentalists that chastise people that are just living their lives.  
People that would actually be happy to believe the science and work on a practical solution all of a sudden feel attacked and start fighting back.  
This turns the entire climate debate into some discussion about morality and people get categorized within good vs evil.  
The problem with this is obvious; people take their eye off the ball and we stop focusing on solving the problem.

I was wondering what type of path is recommended for the field? I’ve heard Environmental Science degrees themselves are pretty well populated and many people hold the degree making getting jobs with it trickier than others in the field. I was hoping to maybe take the geology/geography track with my bachelors degree. 

My one hold up with geology is that I’m limited to online school right now given my current situation. I know that online geology degrees are pretty worthless given the lack of “hands on” experience that is vital to a geology degree. My question I guess is could I still break into the environmental field with a BS in geography (online, if that matters) and perhaps expand with a MS in geology after? Will a BS in Geography be useful in the environmental field at all?

Like this:

 [https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Unclog-a-Main-Drain-Step-2.jpg/aid11018372-v4-728px-Unclog-a-Main-Drain-Step-2.jpg.webp](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/41/Unclog-a-Main-Drain-Step-2.jpg/aid11018372-v4-728px-Unclog-a-Main-Drain-Step-2.jpg.webp) 

&amp;#x200B;

And in most cases, the access is in the back yard, usually in the corner of the fence. In other words, the perfect place to put up a little privacy screen.

My question is why couldn't you simply pee directly into the main drain? By installing what would amount to basically a tall funnel into the main drain access, you would have a very cheap, very efficient waterless urinal. Yea, it might get a little funk to it eventually, but not if you live in a place that gets regular rain, which is like 98% of places in the US.

We defend the freedom of having absolute control of the information by users, freedom that has been compromised lately.

We also believe that the Internet must be a safe place for its inhabitants, because yes, millions of people in the 21st century live on the Net.

We are aware that, although we live in the Information Society, not everything we read on the web is true and reliable. We are not only aware, but we are working on the solution.

But it does not appear so, is it because officially Occidental never owned those wells or is it because of the E&amp;P waste exclusion and the petroleum exclusion?

0,environmental_science,Need some insight after a debate with a climate change denier," Hey people

I was recently debating a denier of anthropogenic climate change on reddit, and he made me aware that I wasn't as well informed on the subject as I'd want to be. I want to put down some of the points he raised here, and if anyone is well informed on these issues, I'm keen on hearing your take on it:

His basic point is:

* Anthropogenic climate change (ACG) is not falsifiable and therefore not scientific.

And he backs this up with:

* Science breaks down in the face of chaos systems and the future at large. Too many unknowns, and too many uncontrollable variables.
* We haven't eliminated every other explanation for the data.
* **It's ACG's job to provide some predictive power which it has not done.** (he raises this point several times)  

   * I've yet to see any auxiliary theories of ACG yield useful or meaningful predictive power, so if you claim that they've been tested, I'm deeply skeptical.
* I suspect this is due to a watering down of scientific standards that's been going on for decades.
* Overly simplistic models that don't match reality.
* All of the apparent changes in climate are still within normal variations across a geological time frame.
* While humans may influence the climate, that influence can be easily overstated.
* The way climate science influences public policies and politics is an extreme overreaction.
* All of this is not so much an evil conspiracy as much as I suspect it is a collective blind spot, or to put it bluntly, a circlejerk.

And he brings up:

* Bjorn Lomborg and his book ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"" which pulls into doubt many of the statistical analyses that climatologists have performed
* [https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ten-most-important-climate-change-skeptics-2009-7?r=US&amp;IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-ten-most-important-climate-change-skeptics-2009-7?r=US&amp;IR=T), a list of prominent climate change skeptics, including Freeman Dyson

2,environmental_science,Engineering vs. Wildlife Bio,"I'm an undergraduate studying biological systems engineering. I recently transferred from a community college where I studied physics and math. Basically, my ecology courses and my riparian management/restoration internship have been the highlight of my experience so far at this 4-year university. I thought I liked biological applications of engineering, but I'm starting to suspect that I only like biology, math, and working with my hands. I do fairly well in my classes but I don't think I have an ""engineering brain"", and I'm not all that passionate about engineering itself.

So I'm thinking of switching to wildlife conservation biology. I've invested a lot of time into the whole engineering thing: three years at community college and one year here. I've taken nearly all the lower division and a few upper division courses. But regardless of which major I choose, I'll need two more years to finish a degree. I thought of double-majoring, but it would require a whole extra year.

I've been looking at youtube videos to help me make a decision and honestly, wildlife bio seems like an amazing career. I'm a bit worried about how hard it seems to be to find a job, especially a stable one. At the same time, seasonal work seems kind of attractive to me. I've also been looking into environmental engineering. I like that they spend time in the field, but it seems like they do more chemistry-related testing (like for water quality) than anything biological.

Does anyone have advice on what else I should research and how I should go about making my decision? Any thoughts are appreciated.",1590980355

I am graduating next Spring and was weighing my options. I could move and start working but I could also pursue a Masters in a few really good env/forestry programs here but I understand one should have work experience beforehand.

I am 33 and have about 15 years of IT experience and a lot of work experience in tech support, office management, and 2 years of field experience as a contractor (but that was about 8 years ago). I will have some more field experience this year too since internships are required for my BS degree.

Should I try for the masters program or does my experience have to be relevant to the job? Other than GIS and basic office skills, my IT experience doesn't seem relevant and at my age, I don't want to waste time.

Any advice, recommended certs, etc... is all appreciated. I am interested in eventually being an environmental consultant but am also interested in air quality, water quality, forestry, env policies, and well... im open to A LOT.",1590343471

I am trying to prepare myself to get a job after graduating next year and would like some guidance.

Due to the pandemic I wasn't able to do that but I'm still interested in working for them.

If anyone has any experience working for them please let me know how it went for you. I have heard of working as an environmental consultant, if anyone has any insight on what this job entails I would greatly appreciate it. 

I have taken many biology courses and I'm going to take a geology course and GIS course in the fall. I don't have any experience working on any GIS programs, is there any way I could practice or prepare before starting my class? I have also been interning for a professor and assisting him with his research. His research is heavily based on plant physiology which is not really a subject I am interested in but I have gained a lot of experience with inputing and analyzing data. I also enjoy going out into the field to collect data.

Anyway, given the way things are unfolding with this pandemic, I’ve been pretty concerned for the future and unemployment. In the meantime, my goal is to continue building my skills.

In this era of Anthropocene, it is important to look at all the areas either it is inward or outward to locate systemic options. Individuals might or even might not be “a problem on earth” as Donald Attenborough mentioned, however, we're undoubtedly the actual dominating pressure on this earth. A few more self-examinations is required in the event that we're to make use of the energy ethically.
  as Organizational Outreach Official with regard to Populace Issues, it is also important to get in touch with ethically-oriented companies (from belief companies in order to environment NGOs) as well as recommend ways the problem associated with populace development might be protected on the web site as well as built-into their own ethos. Numerous companies We strategy concur which populace dimension plays a role in environment alter, turmoil as well as malnutrition, however they often react through stating how the concern is beyond their own remit. Populace Matters’ customer Jonathon Porritt discusses why companies prevent referencing populace development with this 14-minute movie, debunking several misconceptions on the way (Atkins &amp; Bowler, 2016).
To become genuinely systemic, it is essential to incorporate just about all facets of the issue. What exactly is actually “systemic” or even “systems thinking”? Basically, it's a strategy with regard to examining complicated problems through watching all of them naturally, because purposeful techniques that contain interdependent parameters, stakeholders as well as viewpoints. Along with this, population growth is also affecting the production of food and ethically speaking, no proper distribution is being done especially in poor countries. This enables a comprehension associated with one’s personal prejudice as well as restrictions. Techniques professionals make use of simple diagrams to discover crucial problems so when this really is carried out adequately, they could begin to see the interwoven interpersonal, financial, politics as well as environment measurements.
 The problem below analysis this is actually the worldwide food program, the objective of that is in order to give food to people (and to some extent livestock) on the continual time period. It's inlayed within as well as determined by ‘macro’ techniques because proven within the diagram beneath (McClements, 2019).


The food program is actually one of several techniques tasked along with satisfying human being natural requirements. These types of anthropogenic techniques rely on the actual broader environment existence assistance construction supplied by our planet, such as the environment, power from the sunlight and also the worldwide drinking water period. To be able to much better value meals protection as well as durability, it's very first essential to realize the primary effects upon as well as causal cable connections from the meals program. The food and agriculture organization (FAO) give a great account of the within their book ‘The long term associated with meals as well as agriculture’.
The actual percentage associated with food needs more than manufacturing may be the key impacting the amount of meals protection, however additional elements consist of reasonable food submission, in addition to power as well as supplies effectiveness that has a good impact upon just about all parameters.  Aside from food, other typical parameters tend to be individuals as well as creatures. Individuals also provide privileges, requirements as well as viewpoints that have to be accommodated; plus they possess biases as well as cognitive restrictions that ought to end up being recognized (DeCamp, et.al, 2018).
In poor countries, where popular growth is high, unethical parameters are been adopted due to which most of the people are suffering. Therefore, it is important to think for those people and to fulfil their needs accordingly. Government authorities that have been applying this particular (e.g. Bangladesh, Iran, Ethiopia, Thailand, Indonesia) are in possession of less male fertility price as well as ‒ a minimum of regarding the Philippines ‒ each a decrease in malnutrition as well as lower-income as well as quicker financial development. A present, as well as long term issue, is actually The African continent in whose populace is actually likely to go up through 1. two million in order to two. 5 million through 2050. The amount of individuals globally struggling with persistent food cravings is actually a lot more than eight hundred zillions. May an increasing populace allow it to be simpler or even tougher to lessen this particular struggling? Based on Jonathon Porritt: “… to satisfy the requirements from the 215 zillion ladies all over the world that actually have absolutely no use of efficient birth control might price close to $3. 5 million annually ‒ the small fraction associated with today’s help circulation. ”
It's helpful to regularly discover one’s personal considering as well as possibly re-evaluate long-held preconceptions. Of course, focusing upon decreasing the intake of food might have unintentional outcomes in the event that this diverts through alternative options, however, therefore, may the actual deterrence have associated with unpleasant problems for example populace development.

I’m looking to post about environmental biology and I’m looking for some advice. 
I would like to know if you could help me bring most of the facts to the post. 
The questions go like this.
Who needs environmental biology in their field.
(Example:  photographs need to understand optics)
contribution of environmental biology in the modern day(like in movies, normal days,etc). 
I would like to know who’s your model and what they bring in the field, if you don’t have a role model in environmental biology can you tell me more about the pioneers and their contributions.
It would mean so much to me to get your help and your knowledge. 

Thank you,

5,environmental_science,The scientific solution for saving the environment is only one.,"Dear redditors of r/environmental_science, 

little we know about science, but if the little we understands is correct then the future is not bright for us; this planet is changing, humans are shaping it in a twisted way that is disrupting all the current equilibria.

Between all the pollutants we throw in the environment a certain class is doing more damage than all the rest combined: the greenhouse gases. Therefore our scientific solution should be to reduce as much as possible these factors.

Then what is from a *scientific* point of view the solution? 

**Nuclear energy.**

This is the solution for climate change. There is no room for debate, for attacks, for discussions; scientifically speaking nuclear is the only source of energy that can solve our environmental problems. If you disagree then you are not informed, you are ignorant on the topic, filled with the bs that the media fed you.

The point of this post is to propose and collects ideas for a shift on the propaganda of the environmental activism. If you have doubt on my statements read [these comments (with sources).](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/92rd3r/what_is_the_best_charity_for_reducing_mans_impact/e3edz5q/) 

What are your proposals to convince the public that nuclear energy is our only hope? How can we change a movement that has roots so deep around the anti-nuclear ideas?",1588850012

germany is removing nuclear plants and replacing with natural gas, only the name is natural else it's is more potent gas than co2 and it leaks from pipes.

I would rather have military keep a football ground size nuclear waste facility safe in a area 51 like facility. than poision the whole environment with co2.

EROI of 7 is required to maintain society at the current level.  
and solar pv and bio mass wont' come close and hydro, solar csp and wind have limited areas where they are economical. more over hydro release methane gas, solar csp, solar pv and wind require steel and which requure mining and the amount of carbon they release in their making is a deal breaker.

coal and natural gas we want to avoid.

leaving us with nuclear which provide amazing base load capacity.

If not all atleast replace the base load with nuclear and have your solar and hydro, because I think co2 released by them will be less than co2 by coal and natural gas power plants.

Is hatered and fear of nuclear more than fear of poisioning our air. Please wake up to reality.",1588775682

I built a firewood holder with some scrap material. In the past couple years, mice have gotten into the firewood. Despite using traps, they keep coming back and I catch another one or two every few weeks(I've probably used 20+ traps, not sure if they have a hive in the sewers or a neighbour has an infestation). Long-term I plan to elevate the firewood holder on bricks so it is another foot high (hopefully the mice will stop getting into my lumber), but my question is what to do now.

My plan is to burn the wood, and then clean the droppings with a surgical mask, a broom/dustpan, and bleach water mix.

My question is: is it safe to burn the wood for a family campfire if mice have potentially pooped or peed on it? Should I put on gloves and leave the wood outside in the sun for 3 days or so before I burn it? Or do I need to throw the bottom row of wood away? How risky is hantavirus for me? If I use work gloves to move the wood, can the virus live on the surface for days? Does a campfire burn away any virus?

Below are some pics. Those black pieces are poop (camera colouring is a little off) and the last picture is my latest catch today.

I have considered a number of options for graduate school. My current institution doesn't offer its own engineering program, but it does offer a 3-2 engineering track with a couple other schools (which I didn't take). So other than my physics degree I have no actual engineering experience.

I'm planning to pursue a BS degree in environmental science in Canada (as an international). I've been accepted to two of their top schools (UBC and McGill) and have ultimately chosen UBC because it's better in the subject. I'm more interested in lab-work than field-work, and would like to focus more on the biotechnology aspects of the major. UBC has offered me a choice for either Bachelor of Science general (I can specialise into environmental science later) or Natural Resource Conservation. I didn't pick the second because I thought it would be too field based with less focus on the science aspect. 

Now, I've been seeing posts on how I shouldn't take up this major. I'd like to know if the job prospects in Canada specifically are good. I'd also like to know whether a minor in biotechnology or ecology would be better. I was also accepted for environmental engineering in a few other schools, but decided not to pursue it because I'm not too interested in civil-engineering. What would you recommend I do?

Hi everyone, and thanks in advance for any ideas. I’m about to finish high school, but with two years of college coursework done, I  need to declare a major right away. There are definite costs and benefits to the situation. While I’m certain I want to pursue a science (my dream was always research) that, in a best case scenario, has an outdoor component, I’m worried that hoping to do actual field work will be an unrealistic goal. I just don’t want to end up with a desk job or resort to working policy eventually.

While the school I’ve committed to has an awesome and well established college of environmental science, it doesn’t offer an environmental engineering option. I’m starting to think this would be a better fit personally, and after some research I found it is possible to graduate with an environmental science BS and still get accepted to a master’s degree program for environmental engineering. I’m already done with my calc, chem, and bio lab sequences, so I should have a little leeway over the next few years to sort things out.

Just so I can start mentally preparing, does anyone know of some general requirements/ engineering related topics I should expect to look into or undergrad coursework necessary keep this pathway available?

This is something that can be pursued from the comfort of your home amidst quarantines all over the world. 


Our functioning will be in a chapter-wise fashion where each chapter founder (wherever in the world they may be) forms a core team locally. The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization’s executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.

 You are welcome to initiate and lead a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.


If not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-

1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. 

2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. 

3. Artists, musicians, singers, poets, dancers, anyone with a creative streak who would like to express and promote the cause of environmental sustainability through art forms!

***Hello, if you want the summarized version the ""Questions to keep in mind"" at the top and the part titled ""The Dilemma"" at the bottom are the bulk of my concerns, everything in between is background info on me.***

**Questions to keep in mind**

· Do I need a master’s degree to pursue my desired career path (ecological restoration) (wetland restoration in particular)?

· Can I get to my desired career path with my bachelor’s degree and more field experience?

· Is getting a master’s degree worth the 2 years of lost wages?

   Hello, my name is Aaron. I graduated with my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science in December 2018. I immediately started a 6-month AmeriCorps term under ACE (American Conservation Experience). We performed tasks such as trail maintenance, historical preservation, and ecological restoration (exotic plant management, stream restoration, etc.). I also gained training and certifications during my term such as WFA (wilderness first aid), Sawyer (chainsaw certification), and Pesticide and Safety Training.

   Since the end of my AmeriCorps term I have been unfortunately working jobs unrelated to my field. I applied to multiple jobs related to my field, but I unfortunately did not get those jobs. I fear my inability to get those jobs were due to government nepotism. I e-mailed the employers asking what the short comings of my resume were:

   I bring this up because I am supposed to start a maintenance worker position within the National Park within the next month. I figured with the 6-months of maintenance worker experience and some good references I can gain favor within the government. After I am done with my Maintenance Worker position, I think it is very likely I will be able to obtain a more conservation related job within the National Park. 

**The Dilemma**

   I have been studying for the GRE with the intention of going to Graduate School by January 2021. However, I have been wondering if my time would be better suited advancing my career by gathering more experience. I feel getting my foot in the door of the National Park Service could help propel my career forward new job opportunities. I also have certain concerns about going to Graduate School. I am worried that going to grad school with limited experience could actually hurt me; I feel most employer would rather hire someone with a bachelors and a few years’ experience versus someone with a masters and very limited experience. Also, I am unsure of the possible salary bump (if any) that may or may not come with the master’s degree.

   Thank you for your time. If any of you happen to have experience within the ecological restoration field, particular insight, or know anybody within the field I could contact I would very much appreciated.

90,environmental_science,Vanguard party to fight climate change (not the Green Party)/ a Green COVID-19 Stimulus Plan,"I think that we need to re-think the way we have been trying to fight climate change. 

We have for to long been going to protests that never end up changing anything on their and doing things to “raise awareness”, finding ourselves simply screaming into the void without making any meaningful change. We cannot rely on the current two party system in the USA to fight climate change; the deck is stacked against us and it is realistically never going to happen. We need to make a radical change in strategy.

 We need to form an organization that has its only goal to be fighting climate change, and it needs to be set up in the structure of a vanguard party with democratic centralism (I am not set in stone on this totally, feel free to challenge me). It needs to function like a disciplined political party. 

The reason I think this structure would be effective is because, although I am not here to talk politics, the vanguard party in the Marxist-Leninist tradition is an extremely effective TOOL to an end that has been proven throughout the 20th and 21st centuries to be useful for accomplishing the goal of getting members, educating people, keeping members active, having a coherent and well organized leadership, dedicated cadres, etc. 

It is important that this party ONLY focus on climate change because the more things that we focus on, the more chance there will be for people to disagree with us. So, contrary to what some of you are, and I have been thinking for years, we cannot just work with a regular communist party. This is simply because climate change is such an important issue that we cannot take the risk of someone disagreeing that would have otherwise worked with us. 

This kind of thing is incredibly important if we are going to try to organize the people who already agree that climate change is an important issue. It also makes it so that we don’t need to have ALL members spending all of their time working on this, and it makes the best use of each member that we have through dedicated cadres. 

Once again, I am not saying this would be a communist party, I am saying that we can learn from the STRUCTURE of the party and it’s usefulness as a TOOL. I think this will really be a game changer because this Leninist TOOL is extremely effective and without the bad press and connotation that communism gets, the actual structure and methods can be very useful for something else: fighting climate change. 

So anyways, I believe that we need to have this political party focused on only climate change to have local chapters anywhere we can get more than two members and they can establish a local chapter. There need to be representatives from each chapter in a region to reside over each region as well as representatives from each region that form the central committee and elected general secretary. 

I believe that the most effective democratic structure is democratic centralism, wherein every member gets to voice their concerns and argue for something without fear of reprisals and then everyone votes on the course of action, and the result is binding: everyone, having had the chance to discuss with the group, must now abide by the decision of the majority. This is the most democratic form of things in a party in my opinion. 

Democratic centralism makes it so that the party is much more effective at carrying out its decisions; people will abide by what the majority has decided and do their duties, for example a member may be instructed to moderate a social media organ for the party and try to really engage with at least 10 people that day. 

Anyways, one thing that I think we need to try to get the government to do is a sort of Green COVID-19 Stimulus Plan. 

What needs to be done is the massive mobilization of the millions of people who have lost their jobs among other specialized workers that would be needed in order to construct a large high speed rail network in the USA across the country. Importantly, within each state a high speed rail should be constructed and especially and most importantly within each city there should be a rail or subway network built.

This is a massive infrastructure project, the biggest in the history of the USA no doubt; however, we see the government pumping trillions of dollars now into the economy to try to stabilize it due to the pandemic, and climate change is so much more important that it is not even comparable. 

This would create so many jobs and likely they will be lifetime jobs. Even though it seems daunting, it is NECESSARY. Even if all of it cannot be done now, just starting on the construction of the high speed rail across the country (or in each city, whichever is actually easier or would reduce emissions the most) should be done. 

In addition to the above, or perhaps instead of it, huge amounts of capital and labor should be invested in the production of many electric car factories and anything else that is necessary for their production or use. This would create a ton of good jobs, and with the huge government investment and huge production capacity, it would make electric cars much cheaper than they are now, or at least the government can subsidize their production so as to make them affordable. Their export would also make us money and the center of one of the most important industries in the world. 

The investment in the building of other sources of renewable energy where possible and research and development as well would be important. 

I know what you are thinking: this is so prohibitively expensive that it is impossible. I say you know what; 200 years ago they said that you would never set foot on the moon. I say we need to TRY. Do not just look at a task and think that it will not be possible. We don’t have a lot of options. And you know what? With this COVID-19 induced mass unemployment, this is a good time to have a massive infrastructure projects and developments of new industries; we can train unemployed workers so that they can work on the infrastructure and in these industries. 

Actually that is important separately; we need to try to get the government to offer free training for the unemployed so that they could work in the construction of high speed rail, electric cars, renewable energy, etc.

So what do you think about my idea? I know that it sounds like a pipe dream, but personally I fully believe that I’m going somewhere and I’m gonna do everything I can to try to get the ball rolling. 

Please let me know what you think and any suggestions/criticisms and if you think it’s a good idea, you should PM me!",1587376346

Our functioning will be in a chapter-wise fashion where each chapter founder (wherever in the world they may be) forms a core team locally. The core teams shall calculate the carbon, water, and ecological footprint for their community (by surveying the residents) using our database of user-friendly environmental calculators. After this simple data collection, the core team will analyse and identify the largest environmental problem in their community. Then they will use our resources and collaborate with the organization’s executive board to plan and implement community-based strategies to address this problem and measure impact.

You are welcome to initiate a chapter in your region, form a core team locally, and get going! We're going to be supporting you in the process.


If not interested in chapters, you can join one or more of the following teams that are being formed-


1. Bloggers on anything related to environmental sustainability, ranging anywhere from lifestyle tips to analytical articles. 

2. Social media experts and outreach managers who would be integral to showcasing the mission and accomplishments. 

3. Artists, musicians, singers, poets, dancers, anyone with a creative streak who would like to express and promote the cause of environmental sustainability through art forms!

6,environmental_science,Indirect Approaches?,"**What industries or fields do you guys rely on? Or think there is a need for to support what you do?**

For more context:
I am approaching thirty years of age and am considering going back to education. Like many others I'd like to do something environmentally minded and that has some career paths with more outdoor options. 

However, since I haven't studied science or math subjects in over a decade and being the same again behind most people in the field in terms of experience, I have been asking myself if there's maybe a career path I could be more useful to environmental causes. It might not be one that allows me to spend time outdoors but if it could be useful maybe it is worth it.

Off the top of my head the first thing I can think of is something business/economics related as even if it wasn't directly helping there could be less direct approaches. If I did well there, what I could do could be potentially more useful than an extra (approaching middle age) body in an entry level role. Although the idea of following that path doesn't sound too appealing if I'm honest (Even if I'm maybe more suited to it) so more than open to other suggestions!

For what it's worth I don't have any tangible skills in terms of diplomas or degrees besides high school and have spent the majority of the last decade largely in dull corporate desk jobs or bar work.

As an addendum I do think I could get the science side of things down if I put my mind to it, just trying to determine if it's the most efficient use of what I have to offer.

I have spent most of undergrad working in microbial ecology and I’ve been realizing lately that my passion lies more with animal science/zoology. My university unfortunately offers very little in this department. I plan to go to grad school in the near future but would like to take a bit of time off before then.

What should I do in the meantime? Every “entry level” job I find wants 3-5 years of experience. I don’t know how to get my foot in the door without going broke working unpaid. I’ve heard of certificates, should I work on getting those (and if so, which ones)? Should I take whatever interesting job comes my way and just roll with it, even if it isn’t within my field?

62,environmental_science,Master's advice,"Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some advice on my Master's decision (University of British Columbia vs. Oxford). Both programs cover environmental science and policy, but UBC is a two-year research-based program (with some courses), while Oxford is a one-year course-based program (with some research). UBC is also offering a research stipend and scholarship that would completely cover my tuition and living costs, while Oxford would cost me upwards of $60,000 (CAD) for tuition and living for the year. UBC also offers teaching assistant positions, while Oxford does not.

I really like both programs, but after talking with past graduates of both programs, I think I would learn more at UBC, and I feel that the research experience would be good for me. I'm reluctant to reject Oxford, however, because I know that prestige can matter. So I guess what I'm asking is this -- how important is university prestige when it comes to getting a job? Is it worth some debt (I would probably have to take out about $30,000 in loans)? I'm hoping to go into environmental consulting or policy after this degree, but I have also considered doing research later down the road. Thanks in advance.",1585577270
63,environmental_science,Carbon neutral farming practices,"Greetings,

I have to write this report, and am trying to figure out why farming isn’t very close to being carbon neutral already. 
Say, a farmer starts with 100 acres of fertile land that is already cleared of trees/grass. He plants crops that take carbon dioxide out of the air for 6-8 months. His carbon expense is the machinery to till the land, plant the seeds, fertilize and harvest. Could someone point me to which of those steps is most carbon intensive? All these steps require burning fossil fuels and farmers use 4 gallons of fuel per acre (with filling) to meet the above needs. Each gallon of gasoline burnt outputs 19.64 gallons of C02. This means a farmer outputs 78.56 gallons  of C02 per acre. However, corn sequesters 3.6 tons of C02 per acre. I’m sure other crops produce similar sequester similar amounts as well. 

So what are the other C02 expenses that makes farming so terrible for the environment. There seems to be a wide disparity in production/capture. Please exclude initial deforestation C02 expense.",1585570381

I didn’t even know it was a thing to be honest and I was excited considering I started with graphic design and still felt passionate about that as well.

She's probably doomed to never be hired at this point (thanks coronavirus!) but since things are looking especially desperate it felt like a good time to ask. 

My friend has been searching for a job in a new area (city with 300k people) for about a year. She's applied 700+ jobs that she was at least partially qualified for, and several hundred that were really good fits for her skills. She has 5 years of experience running an environmental lab and has a bachelors degree in environmental health science. She's gotten expert (in and out of her field) advice on her resume and cover letters, she's tailoring her resume and cover letter to each job, she's adding as many people related to the jobs she's applying for on Linked in as she can find (with no response of course), she's been to the local job center, and she's gone to networking events for her field and for her community.  Applying for jobs has been her full time job for this year.  


In all that time, she's been interviewed for one full time position at a University. It seems to have dropped off the face of the planet as the hiring director for that position left and they couldn't hire for the position she applied for until they hired someone else as a director and now coronavirus has shut everything down for the foreseeable future. And one part time position that was supposed to get back to her mid-last week and didn't. They're also now shut down for the virus for the foreseeable future.   


Basically at this point she's defeated, desperate, and has no idea what direction to turn in as what she's doing hasn't worked. She's willing to work any vaguely related job and many that aren't. Basically short of food/customer service jobs she's willing to apply. Anyone have any advice? Are there any guaranteed jobs someone with a BS can get? How about what types of positions she should consider? Any help is appreciated.",1584585198

It was only after a group of highschool students created a video titled [""An Oily Sky""](https://archive.epa.gov/epapages/newsroom_archive/newsreleases/0fd4db3f1fad128b852570cb0075e20c.html), a short two minute documentary on the spill that created national attention , did the cleanup start. The responsible party was BNSF railway, which only recently finished the cleanup. The cleanup project cost $100 million, and ongoing monitoring is still taking place.

[Total treatment facts:](https://apps.ecology.wa.gov/gsp/Sitepage.aspx?csid=34)

Over 350,000 tons of contaminated soil removed

Over 218,000 gallons of oil removed and recycled;

Over 20 million gallons of contaminated water treated

Anyways, the reason I make this post is, does anyone have a copy of the video the highschoolers made?

Here's a little problem. While the degree is okay and all, I just don't feel like 100% committed to it. I originally wanted more towards Marine Sciences and more recently into Earth Sciences / Geography. EnvSci has this focus on the legislation side like policies (Env Law) and Health.

While i do understand that both are very important in this field, frankly I just find it boring. Maybe im being too hasty and that the better ones come around later in my degree.. but i kinda dont wanna wait too long

And as a side note, what kind of jobs does this degree give anyways? I want the marine sciences because im more interested in the oceans and rivers. Geography is cause i like studying about the earth in general. Though im not sure what careers will that translate into

Many thanks",1583334738
48,environmental_science,I need project ideas for my ecology internship - but I'm stumped. Help?," I'm a brazilian undergrad, currently on my last year of biological sciences. I've spent (more like wasted) about two years of that time doing something that had nothing to do with env. sciences (molecular neurology), and now I finally moved on to something else with another professor. They have their own projects going on:

**- Biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems in areas altered by man**

**- Vulnerability of biomes to climate change (heating)**

But I feel like I should show some proactivity and knowledge by designing something of my own. Yet many problems get in my way. Our university is in a highly urban area, there are barely any parks (about two of laughable size), Brazil barely has sites or institutions where I can get information on the state of the environment (or get involved with)... I just don't know what research opportunities there are. What questions there are to be answered or problems to be solved.

I thought of two ideas, but they're too broad:

**- My city's river is in a terrible state, so maybe measure the level of eutrophication throughout its course and correlate it with what's around maybe. Human activity, the state of the surrounding nature, etc.** I just fear we don't have the necessary equipment (science funding here is a joke).

**- Ideas for encouraging the visit of pollinators in my campus, maybe starting with what pollinators there ARE.** Problem here is there's no information on that, so I'd have to start from scratch.

 I'm not really happy with my progress in my ideas. I was wondering if anyone has been in my situation (or can at least comprehend it) and throw some light in what I could do or where to look?

Thank you so much!",1583334115

At the moment my knowledge on the geology/earth sciences part is low, but I want to try to get to get any kind of work with my geosciences dept. as quickly as I’m able to.
My advisor suggested talking to the people in the department about the work I’m interested in that professors have done/are doing. As of late, I’m taking a good amount of time reading and understanding papers involving this particular associate professor.
The thing is that her and many other professors I’m interested in from looking at our dept’s faculty page are either associate professors or I can’t get much info on them besides an email. I say this because I heard associate professors are like entry level and I thought maybe they might not be doing projects/research with or near the uni? Not sure.

I guess what I’m curious about if I should shoot a lot of professors an email basically saying: if you need a body I’m willing to do w h a t e v e r. Or, if I should try to learn more about a professor’s research/project history and try to build a relationship from there with a chance of work that I have a particular interest in?

61,environmental_science,Should I change majors from ChemE to EnvE?,"I'm  currently in ChemE, which I decided to pursue, despite my preference  for the environmental industry, due to the fact that I was under the impression that ChemE is more  widely applicable and gives more career flexibility.  However, I'm  currently starting to wonder whether this was really such a wise  decision as I'm starting to not feel very engaged in the subject matter.   Also, I have to take up to calc 5, which being in calc 4 currently,  I'm not so sure I have another semester of advanced math in me.  It  seems that overall, the EnvE major is more in line with my interests.  I  know I could probably make it through a cheme program, as hard as I  know it will be, but the motivation isn't really there, and I would  probably do much better in EnvE, given my interests.  Even if it is the  same level of difficulty, having something there to keep me engaged,  fixing environmental problems, producing renewable energy, etc, would  definitely be helpful to keep me motivated.

That  said, I am wondering if it would be a good choice from a career  perspective.  Is it hard to find a job as an EnvE?  It seems based on  the statistics, they will both have similar job growth over the next ten  years, although when you search for jobs on indeed, more ChemE jobs  come up than EnvE.  I'm also wondering if I will be able to be involved in what I'm interested in as an EnvE, which is carbon capture technologies, bioenergy, and other green/clean tech.  I know I could do this as a chemE, but not so sure if I could do it as EnvE.

You get to present your findings, but only at a pretty small academic conference then that's it

The other option is an internship where you do research on an urban environmental issue of your choosing. The topic has to be a social environmental issue though, you can't do research on the""hard science"" sort of side (so you can study an environmental justice issue but not a soil quality issue). You choose any topic which relates to an urban environmental issue and do research on that topic for the whole summer. It's solo research but you meet with the head of the program to discuss your project once a week. By the end you get to present the findings of your research at several academic conferences and if its good enough your work might get published.

79,environmental_science,Why care about climate change?,"No, I am not trolling. As a plant biology student, I am well aware of the issues pertaining to our environment, and I myself, do care. Yet, after recently discussing climate change with an individual that is a skeptic, his argument seemed to provoke some thought within me.

This person believes that the Earth is warming, and he also believes that humans are causing most of the damage. However, he argued that no matter what human beings do to this Earth, we are physically incapable of “destroying” the Earth. He believes that no matter what, there is no anthropogenic forcing that can cause damage that this Earth can’t recover from.

It seems like such a flawed argument, but if you compare issues such as plastic pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and a disrupted nitrogen cycle to previous events throughout the history of the Earth, his argument is kind of right. The meteor strike that wiped out an incredibly large portion of the biodiversity on this planet at the time, volcanoes that warmed the Earth to temperatures unimaginable, the Ice Age, and more, all occurred with nothing accredited to a species’ activity on this planet. Furthermore, the Earth’s climate has been incredibly unstable throughout most of the Earth’s history, and it has only been during this current epoch, the Holocene, that our climate has been relatively stable for the last ~10,000 years. Eventually, our climate will inevitably become unstable whether or not humans disrupt the natural flow of things. 

So my question is, why should anyone care about trying to preserve the environment if it will inevitably go to shit again? This whole thing seems pretty grim, and sort of transitions into the famous philosophical dilemma of, “What’s the point of anything?” This is all just very unsettling to me the more that I think about it, because yes, I want to prevent the suffering and extinction of other organisms that we share this planet with. I want my future children to live on a cleaner planet. I want to preserve the natural world because I respect it. But why does any of our collective efforts matter if the environment is naturally going to becoming unstable regardless of what humans do?

I’m a Master’s candidate in Environmental Science- my focus/area of interest is specifically in mosquito control and the impact of green infrastructure on mosquito diversity/abundance/competence as vectors. I’m trying to develop a short-term research project (2-3 months), and I’m running into a lot of difficulties. I don’t have a lot of experience in research/experimental design, and my advisor has been, as the title says, very unhelpful. Also, they’re on sabbatical basically across the world and very difficult to contact. My department chair does not have time or effort to interim advise me, either. My original proposal was to monitor mosquito larvae diversity before, during, and after the implementation of a stormwater management project to see if there’s a change in species makeup or abundance, but I was basically told that it was too long term of an idea.

I’ve asked multiple people (advisor and some people in the field) for help as to how to narrow down the question, but no one seems to have recommendations for where to even start. So, I was hoping reddit with it’s wide range of knowledge might have some suggestions!

I've been working as an environmental consultant in contaminated land for around 3.5 years and I'm at a decent project manager level where I'm fairly autonomous (except for the odd enormous project that pops up).  If I'm being honest though, I find that I'm not uber passionate about contam work and looking towards the future I don't really want any of the senior positions at my current or other workplace (eg more business development).

I fell in to the industry via a few different turns that life provides, but my real passion (because of a rural upbringing) is soil and geomorphology in land management and agriculture (soil erosion, sediment transport, fertility, fluvial processes).  My honors project was based on soil carbon and I worked for a short time at catchment management authority early in my career.  I really liked that type of work but that was almost 5 years ago and my skills have evolved in a different direction since then.  

Main question is, I was wondering if anyone has made the move from contaminated land in to a land management/ag role and if they had any tips?  What type of roles should I be applying for with my current skills? I'm open to public, private or NGO roles.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for some background I going through a conversation between a few friends of mine about the Bushfires in Australia. One of my more liberal friends is saying that while reports are saying that a fair amount of the fires have been initially started by arsonists, they have become more powerful because of the change in seasons and global shift in temperature and climate change. (His words not mine) While some of my more conservative friends are saying that the real reason that the fires are bad is because of all the arsonists and strict dry brush removal policies in the area.   


I'm a bit in the middle, as i would rather not take sides in this argument until i have some form of facts down, but it's hard to look up the statistics online by myself because I keep getting bombarded with news of the bushfires instead of the material i wan't.   


Internally, I am leaning a bit more towards climate change being the biggest factor about why the fires have spread as much as they have, but I am all for taking in new information.",1578419847

**When**: Weds Jan 8 at 1pm ET

**More info**: As the climate crisis intensifies and federal inaction remains, governors across the nation are taking matters into their own hands. A bipartisan coalition of 25 governors, known as the U.S. Climate Alliance, have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  **Minnesota Governor Tim Walz**, **New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham,** and **Hawaii Governor David Ige** are three governors who have prioritized climate action since coming into office. 

Join us for a webinar on gubernatorial action on climate change, featuring the executive-branch officials leading climate efforts. From Minnesota, Environmental Quality Board Executive Director **Will Seuffert** will speak on the state’s recent executive order to create a Subcabinet on Climate Change. Representing New Mexico, Sustainability and Resilience Officer **Laura Tabor** and Environmental Protections Director **Sandra Ely** will discuss the state’s recent emission-reduction recommendations, which evaluates the adoption of an economy-wide cap-and-trade program. From Hawaii, **Anukriti Hittle**, who helps lead Hawaii’s climate change mitigation and adaptation work at the Department of Land and Natural Resources, will discuss some of the state’s recent initiatives. From Maryland, Department of Environment Secretary **Ben Grumbles** will provide an overview of what the state is currently doing to address the climate crisis. This critical and candid conversation will dive into what three states are currently working on, and what the future may hold.",1578063890

I was looking at master's programs in environmental science since but there are two major problems. 

1.  They all have pretty different prerequisites.  
2. Most of the grad schools I called stated they don't want someone who has a bachelor's in an unrelated field even if they complete the prerequisites.

67,environmental_science,BS in Geology or Environmental Science? Which opens up more avenues for jobs?,"Before anyone mentions it, yes, I know that networking for both fields is important. The advice I am looking for is specifically in degrees and whether anyone has felt limited in getting an environmental science degree as opposed to a geology degree. 

Reading over in Geology careers, I've seen that Geologists can be licensed as an enviro scientist but not vice versa, which is more of my concern. My expectation going into either career is to network a ton and start entry level - I don't expect to get a consulting job right off the bat, but that is what I want to work up to. But I also know that in 10-20 years I might want to do a lateral move to a different area and want to make sure that whatever route I have gives me the most opportunity long-term without having to start all over. 

Does geology tend to give more options in terms of licensing for consulting, etc. as opposed to when you go into environmental science? Additionally, can you go into environmental science and then do your Master's in geology? I'm very new to the idea of these majors, so anything helps. 

Again, please don't just comment ""Network a lot!"" because I'm already aware that is part of the process for any degree now to be successful. I just need help in choosing the right degree.",1577923230

74,environmental_science,Liberal arts degrees??,"Sooooo I'm afraid I've messed up. Long story short at the behest of my parents I pursued a (overpriced) liberal arts degree in environmental studies with a focus on biology. The focus consisted of a few upper level bio classes, not enough to minor. Most of the rest of the course work consisted of environmental history, economics, anthropology, and even how to use art to convey scientific information to lay folk. But I know nothing about the actual hard science aspects of environmental science or engineering. 

Currently I work for the government in forestry as a technician. My father owns a logging company I used to work for so it has been easy for me to get entry level forestry jobs but becoming a silviculturalist (the forestry career which would trip my trigger the most) would require a true forestry degree. The good news is im young (26) and this job is giving me some excellent GIS experiance, I read and apply NEPA guidelines in the field, and I took on the safety officer responsibilities for my office to gain some H&amp;S experiance to open up doors to a possible EH&amp;S career. I did briefly work as a coordinator for a small, under resourced, non profit co-op dealing with invasive species. Ive been trying to pursue government NEPA jobs but those seem few and far between. I'd also really like to get into private industry. 

What I am wondering is how to go forward while maximizing my earning potential? I got into this wanting to do a whole bunch of good (and still do sorta) but as I mentioned I paid a boat load for school so now I care a lot more about is making that money (and getting more time in the office). I'd like to avoid going back to turn my lib arts degree into some kind of forestry or engineering masters degree as that would cost even more (upfront at least). But are there any enviro sci/eng associates degree programs which would qualify me to work as an environmental scientist or engineer in combination with my liberal arts bachelors? Or do you have any advice for a liberal arts dorkle like me trying to make it in a STEM world?

University here is 5 years and our degree covers a lot of subjects, forestry, environmental sciences like ecology and so, since I am now a graduate I am completely lost on what to do. I am writing here because I am planning to leave Greece after doing a one year post graduate degree on ecology and forest management, to work or further study in Europe. Environmental sciences interest me a lot however I have no idea what job I will be doing or what to pursue as further studies as in university we were taught a lot of different subjects.

Forestry in Greece does not have many career prospects, a graduate can either work in the government which due to the economic crisis doesn't accept new employees easily and the pay is very low, or in private companies where again, it is very difficult to find a job and the pay is still low. A third option would be to go for further studies like a phd. From my limited understanding of how things work I think I would be really interested in something like that because I find it more interesting.

Again I am asking for advice here because it is certain that in order to find a job or a good further education I will have to leave Greece to study abroad. I have recently taken the c2 exams in French and I am waiting for the results by the end of January. I believe I have passed it. I am about to do my mandatory military service here which is 9 months and then I want to do a post graduate degree here which is a year. I will discuss this with my professors in the university, but I want to find information myself to have a general idea as for what I am looking for.

I have heard that good options abroad are the Netherlands, especially the Waneningen university, the rest of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

All in all I would like to know what are some career options with my degree and if I can do something like a phd. I have some very vague ideas of what I want to do. I have these thoughts about working in forest management as a researcher in national parks or something like that but I don't want to get carried away and be unrealistic. Also I would like to know how much different options pay to balance my life a little bit.

1,environmental_science,Why is it that the Thar Desert in Northwestern India has so many plants and animals?,"Hello everyone. Right now I'm doing some research to get a handle on why deserts are the way they are. The Thar Desert seems like an interesting outlier. Wikipedia says this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Stretches of sand in the desert are interspersed by hillocks and sandy and gravel plains. Due to the diversified habitat and ecosystem, the vegetation, human culture and animal life in this arid region is very rich in contrast to the other deserts of the world. About 23 species of lizard and 25 species of snakes are found here and several of them are endemic to the region.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some [wildlife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife) species, which are fast vanishing in other parts of India, are found in the desert in large numbers such as the [blackbuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbuck) (*Antilope cervicapra*), [chinkara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinkara) (*Gazella bennettii*) and [Indian wild ass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_wild_ass) (*Equus hemionus khur*) in the [Rann of Kutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rann_of_Kutch). They have evolved excellent survival strategies...

The article says that the unique properties of this desert, which has a lot of wildlife, people and plant life compared to other deserts, are due to a diversified habitat. But why exactly?

Sand mixed with plains of sand and gravel and interspersed by small hills doesn't sound to me like a recipe for this kind of biodiversity. Am I wrong? Or is there something else in the picture on the grander scale that makes the Thar desert easier to live in than other deserts?",1576485034

15,environmental_science,Phase 2 ESA testing question,"Hello everyone.

I'm reviewing a proposed scope for a Phase 2 ESA and the consultant has listed a laboratory test that I'm simply not sure about allowing to remain.

The line item reads 'Percent Moisture/Dry Weight (Soil)'

Now, for a little more information, my department (a state government agency) has Phase 2 ESA Guidelines that are meant to expand upon the ASTM 1903-11 with specific prescriptions of what tests are to be done among other things.  
These guidelines are meant to be followed as well as the ASTM by consultants.
Our department's guidelines do not prescribe moisture content testing.


That being said, what would be the upsides of getting soil moisture content testing as a part of a Phase 2 sampling regime?

So I'm an environmental scientist doing a lot of field work. Right now the big project has been reinspecting schools for asbestos containing materials. Part of that is looking inside drop ceilings and crawl spaces. I've been doing these for 3 months or so now, and I have some questions about exposure. 

I'm concerned that I'm taking home excess amounts of fibers via doing crawlspace inspections. I wear all the proper ppe but I still think some of it gets inside my suit and on my clothes. I'm also not a fan of getting fiberglass and God knows what else all over me from the ceilings, but no one seems to care that much about that in my team. 

I wash my clothes with the family's laundry. I'm concerned I'm getting fibers all over their stuff too. Can anyone who has related experiences tell me what they do? Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy trying to contain and clean everything, I even considered just buying new clothes altogether. 

I am getting a hepa vacuum soon and plan on cleaning my house like crazy. Pretty sure I got crawlspace dust in my phone from taking pictures, not even sure what to do about that...

The restoration job held some satisfaction but unfortunately was with a company that was very poorly run and I ultimately needed to move on.

I’ve also spent time volunteering with the nature conservancy doing photography, field data collection for hydrology research and stewardship activities. While I find this awesome, openings with the nature conservancy are limited. I think that I ultimately need to be chasing my passion (applied science that generates change and environmental advocacy using art) instead of a conventional position that pays well and I’m looking for advice on how to reach that.

Government work really interests me but I’m not sure where to start! My interests are wetland science, hydrology, conservation/restoration, ecotoxicology, brownfield remediation, agroecology/agricultural runoff. 
Do i start finding temp positions so I can get my foot into the door? Or should I go into grad school so I can specialize in one of these interests and then go from there? Do government employers appreciate applicants with non profit experience? I’m located in the Midwest if that helps with your answer.


There’s a lot going on in this post but hopefully it all makes sense and I appreciate all input given 

TL;DR - I’m almost 3 yrs into my environmental career and struggling to find fulfillment. Hold interests largely in natural resource management, toxicology and agriculture and need advice on how to get into gov work.",1573500322

14,environmental_science,Carbon Offset for flights formula?,"Hi All, 

Wondering if you can help (if anyone has any suggestions for better places to post this, please let me know!)

I run a website which quotes flight prices, we're looking for a way to encourage clients to offset their carbon emissions. We want to be able to display the carbon created for each flight option, however we're really struggling to find a calculation to display anything close to an accurate carbon emission from the flights (I'm aware that carbon emissions are an art rather than a science). 

We have access to the following for each flight:

Distance,

Duration,

class of travel

And we need a way to turn this into an amount of c02 released for each flight. We've spent hours searching online and not come up with anything. Is anyone able to help?

I know I would love to be involved with the environmental conservation efforts and/or involvement with wildlife protection, but damn, if reading into various discussions online does the job opportunity sound kind of bleak and unstable. I know it's not exactly lucrative, and many of you bounce from seasonal job to seasonal job with periodic unemployment between them.

That wouldn't faze younger, less cautious me, but I am a little older and wonder if it's too late and too much of a gamble to risk throwing myself into.

I'm currently in the process of separating from the Army, have my associates in science, and planned to finish off my bachelor's in another two years. I've been looking at a Bachelors of Science in Environmental Science from UT Austin. Problem is I will be 30 at the earliest when I finish. I am terrified of the idea of being in my 30s, new to the field, and having what appears to be extremely limited opportunities. On top of that I am married and a homeowner, so I have responsibilities that need to be considered. 

Unfortunately it's really the only direction I am interested in academically, so I am not really sure what I should do here.

What advice do those of you have that are in this line for work? Are there any niche degrees/avenues to pursue that provide better opportunities? Anything to reassure my plans to make this extremely important topic the focus of my career?",1573052943

I went into college a little late because I had dropped out of high school and had to take a year off to work then get my GED. When I began I knew that environmental science was something I’ve always wanted to do and now was the chance. I was in a pretty rough situation already, my mom had kicked me out and I was staying with a friend while working an awful job. I was drained from doing it all and I didn’t do too well. I picked myself up, got my shit together even got married and did amazing my next year. Until I couldn’t afford it and had to take a semester off to work and pay off my next semester. Financial aid kicked in next year but surprise surprise I was pregnant. My daughter is the best thing to ever happen to me and I, in no way place any blame on me getting pregnant but I had to take another semester off to have her and then stay home with her. 

Cut to next semester, again I did really great. Unfortunately my husband got a new job which relocated us and I had to start at another university. It was rough because a lot of my credits didn’t transfer and I felt I was getting further away from my goals. This semester I can’t seem to pass simple classes like chemistry. I’m having so much trouble and anxiety, financial aid gave me just 2 more years to graduate or no more financial help. I’m honestly exhausted. Science majors deserve the world for working as hard as they do. I’m just really at an end. I’m at a constant battle with myself and I can’t do it anymore. 

I’m changing my major to something not science related and keeping my minor at environmental science since I already did 3 years of env sci related courses. It feels like I did them all for nothing and I also feel like I let everyone down. First person in my entire family to go to college and I couldn’t do it.

Does anyone have any examples or experience with Phase I ESAs for natural gas plants? I'm working a Phase I ESA for a site, small natural gas gathering and processing plant, and am struggling with how to present a lot of the findings. I'm not seeing many examples of these online for reference. 

Big picture, it's a damn natural gas plant being bought by another gas company, ofcourse there's small staining here and there. The site doesn't have any major spills or anything and is actually a tightly ran shop. Great SPCC documentation, highly trained staff, everything's in order. There's just small de minimis oil residue on the gravel surrounding a lot of the equipment. It's clearly not from large spills or leaks, just buildup over the years, and doesn't pose a threat to human health or environment IMO. And the buyer certainly doesn't care about this small stuff. 

I was just hoping to find some other examples of Phase I ESAs to review for ideas how to present these de minimis findings. For example, am I calling out every single little stained gravel area, or just group them together by equipment type or area?

Is it also common that hiring managers in this line of work do not respond to job postings at all or not for a long time?

Science and statistics. I love data analysis, sampling schemes and experimental design, data collection and it’s applications to a larger project or goal. I also really enjoy the multidisciplinary nature of Environmental Science and all of the hard science that goes along with it. 

I also find management very appealing as I am currently a manager at my job and predict I will get a Masters in ~5 years to help myself achieve a more senior position, either in industry or academics. 


I should provide that I have taken Calc I, Stats, Env Stats and plenty of core and concentration Env Science classes.

I’m currently choosing between a master in ”Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering”, which is a math based double degree master with a partner university (probably TU Berlin), and the master Theoretical Physics. 

Climate modeling sounds interesting to me, so therefore the COSSE master sounds relevant, but I’m worried it will be hard to develop Climate models without really deep physics knowledge, and on the contrary, I’m worried that Theoretical Physics might not give me enough knowledge about modeling at all.

However, I’m not only interested in the modeling part, and as you can probably notice, very split in what type of area of interest I would like to delve into.

2,environmental_science,Advice on how to develop method to measure energy released by algae for biofuel,"

Repos from my other subreddit:
I am second year university student, and I am trying to come up with plans to do my research on green energy from biofilms from waste water. 

I am not sure what the best methods are to measure the energy released by them and then discuss how this is comparable for greener energy or biofuel.

As in can I measure the oxygen and the co2 released by them and then compare when look at how mcuh energy is used to heat up a house or create a food product? In other words, how do I develop a method to see if the energy released by biofilms or algae can replace energy used in the industry?

3,environmental_science,Need help in determining a Study Path,"Hey, I just began studying Environmental Sciences online (edX) and while I figure out how to make this new life objective work I'd like to keep on studying. 

My Introduction Course had the following subjects: Intro Overview, Human Population, Food and Soils, Non-Renewable Energy, Renewable Energy, and Global Change. 

I liked how soils work so I'm keeping that for later, but in the mean time, to continue this path, I'm not really sure what to study next. I was thinking about a longer Introduction Course, but maybe that's not the most practical. 

My interest from the very beginning, and for some years now, are Forests. I'd like to focus on restoration and rehabilitation of biospheres. I'm not sure if I should add some Geology to my Study Path because I'm already interested in soils. 

The path would be something like this: 

1. Introduction to Environmental Sciences
2. Introduction 2 (?)
3. *something*
4. *something 2*
5. *subject of interest*
6. *subject of interest 2*

There's really not a path, so, here I am asking for help.",1568476776

6,environmental_science,My thesis almost got rejected and i need some help," 
So last night I submitted my first draft thesis titled ""  **Heavy Metal Assessments of wetland soils in the saltwater swamp ""** to my adviser and she told me that my objectives were too broad and difficult to conduct plus she mentioned that the cost for ICP is too expensive for a student to afford. I already gave her my thesis outline 1 week ago and my adviser was interested to handle it but now her thoughts have changed after I showed my rationale, objectives and framework. 

Here is a glimpse of my 1st draft:

  

**General Objective:** 

The purpose of this study is to measure the heavy metal constituents in the wetland soils of the saltwater swamp of Magapo, Brgy. Central, Mati City 

**Specific Objective:** 

**1.** To measure the heavy elements (Zn, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Co, and Fe) that could potentially exist in the sediments.

2. To document the anthropogenic activities that contribute to the discharge of heavy metals

3. To measure the physicochemical parameters in order to correlate between factors from the environment to the occurrences of heavy metals.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any way that I could narrow down my objectives, or should i focus on one heavy metal or risk my self and proposed a new one.  

My backup plan is to assess the SPOM if this doesn't work through.

Can anyone speak to the veracity of his comment? I tried to research it online especially the part about how we end up release the methane eventually anyway, but couldn't find anything. Thank you for any help.  
   
His comment, ""Do you know what happens to Gases that are produced from oil wells? (At least those Wells which aren’t close enough to tie into a pipeline.) After it is pumped up to the surface, it passes through what’s called a “Separator”. Liquid (theoretically oil for the purposes of this discussion) and gas are separated. The liquid then passes on towards a collection point. The gas, however, travels up a pipe, usually about 50’-100’ into the air, where it is set on fire. At this point, it is released into the air. It’s known as “flaring”, and it has been a common practice for a very long time.   


The mega oil companies you are reading about here, commonly referred to as “the Majors”, are in favor of this particular regulation, because it is something that only they have the capital to carry out. It’s important to note that the leaks referred to in this article are part of a separation process, in which the end result is ultimately released into the air. Now I understand that we all have obviously differing opinions on this topic; but I just wanted to point out that this move is actually not about filthy, greedy, evil oil companies getting making even more money. It’s intended to make room for some of the smaller players to have a seat at the table, also.  


...and remember this: No matter who does or doesn’t do this or that, at the end of the day, it’s all being released into the air, anyway. Which, to me, would seem to indicate that this article is somewhat disingenuous; in as much as you are only being provided with a very limited portion of the facts surrounding this issue. I don’t mean to imply that it is “right” or “wrong”, only that there is a lot more to know. """,1567176690

Right now I'm working on how this would affect the climate of North Africa. 

So far I've been looking at maps of the rain, and watching earth.nullschool.net for well over a year to see how the winds and precipitation changes over the year. 

From my observations of what happens over arabia, and the way the monsoons work I've come to this sort of conslusion

During the winter months Rain will be dumped over North africa and the Nile river basin. Then during the summer the arabian ""sea"" only send some dotted small storms across north africa and northward over mesopotamia, and the nile would flood as usual. 

The Sahara would largely say green most of the year round, and large grasslands would be stable, with an annual small monsoon dumping rain all over it.

This involves field work (using GPS, removing invasive species, learning sensitive fauna and wildlife in the Bay Area), ArcGIS mapping and some technical writing/research (collecting and reviewing permits from US Army Corp of Engineers, writing reports). Also reaching out to local stakeholders, non-profits and organizing community days. This is more biology oriented.

The second one is working in LA creating solutions to implement several small cities’ climate adaptation plan. This involves running meetings, collecting data, technical writing and working with stakeholders in a huge variety of communities. Potential for R and GIS use. Heavy focus on technical writing, research and interacting with multiple stakeholders. This is more planning and policy oriented. 

The pay is the same at both places and has a very low paying stipend. I know LA well but not the Bay Area. I have a background/experience with: ArcGIS, Collector, Env Law/Policy, ecological restoration, R/data analysis, CEQA/NEPA, journalism and reviewing ESAs and EIRs. I have some experience doing the Bay Area job so I’d enhance on that and learn some new skills dealing with permitting and Bay Area ecology. I have no experience with writing or researching climate action jobs so it would be all new and potentially more difficult.

I am currently thinking about grad school. I have realized that I am much more passionate about the scientific side of things rather than policy. I think I want to apply to some climatology/ atmospheric science masters programs to start in fall 2020. The problem is that while I am passionate about climatology, I have little experience in it. I also have very little experience in computer modeling. I know a decent amount of information about the basics of the subject because I read up on it outside of class, but I have never received formal instruction on the subject. I also have minimal lab experience. I do have lots of policy-based knowledge regarding climate change and environmental science from my studies, however. Ideally, my long-term goal would be to work in research or academia. 

So my main questions are: Do you think that it would be possible to get into a grad program for Atmospheric Science/ Climatology even though my undergrad background was more policy-focused? Is there a way to get experience in climate modeling outside of class? Are there any skills you recommend picking up before applying? Or any general words of advice? Thanks so much.",1566242475

98,environmental_science,College Major/Future Career Advice,"Hello.  I’m an entering freshman majoring in environmental science this year.  Obviously, with so much time left, I don’t have a set vision of what exactly I want to do with this major, other than just generally help the world. I do also have a love for chemistry so much so that I’ve been considering double majoring with chemistry (specializing in biochemistry) since a lot of courses naturally overlap. I have a few questions regarding this and environmental science in general:

1) Is the payout from a double major of Env. Science and Biochemistry worth it in the long run? As in, for most future careers, would they make me look much more appealing as a candidate for a job?

2) I’ve heard many stories about the stress and workload that comes with a science major. I’m naturally a pretty stressed and anxious person, so would double majoring even with so many courses overlapping make college too hellish?

3) My family naturally asks the question, “What are you going to do with your major and does it pay well?” and having an answer such as “I’m not exactly sure” bothers them.  Knowing my love for both environmental science and chemistry, as well as that I’m hopefully going to at least get my Master’s degree, what would be some of the best career paths to research?

4) Is there any other information or advice that you could give out now that you wish somebody would have told you, regarding either Env. Science as a major or a career choice?

I know that’s a lot of questions to throw out at once, especially given that I haven’t even started college yet. Don’t feel like you need to answer all of them. As I said previously, I’m just stressed and anxious about making the right choices for a major and ultimately a career. I understand a lot can change in 4 years, but I’d just like some insight from people who’ve accomplished this goal. Thank you for your time in reading/responding to this post.",1565666435

I've been an environmental consultant for 5 years. I mostly work on Phase I ESAs, site investigations, and remediation projects, and I love it. I work in a city for a large national consulting company, but am dying to move somewhere quieter and smaller, where environmental jobs are few and far between or non-existent. The remote work options I have come across through job board research consist of:

1. GIS mapping (I'm decent, but probably not good enough to do it as a full time position) 
2. Phase I ESA writing (involves a ton of travel for site recons)
3. Permitting (stormwater, air permits, etc)
4. NEPA work (I don't have any experience in this area)
5. Sustainability (usually nothing real or concrete, usually looks like part time low paying contract editorial work)
7. Very high level professional positions, such as regional managers for certain group practices at large companies (for which I am not qualified)

I am attempting to help a client, who runs a concrete facility, find a suitable home for what they consider a waste byproduct at this time. 

After their trucks deliver a batch, if the entirety is not consumed, they run it through a Scrommel Reclaimer which has two corkscrews designes to separate the gravel and sand separately and then a watery cement sand is remaining. A series of settling basins is separate by weirs to slowly get the cement particles to fall out of the water column. Water continues on and is reused for truck washout and reclaimation process.

 The issue at hand is what to do with the ""cement fines"" left over. I am able to find a bit of practicle suggestions rather than ""landfill"" but throught i would see some suggestions from this community. The material is fiarly clumpy sand sized particles with a moderately high pH and a decent amount of lime, calcium and magnesium.

The entire time I was in getting my degree I was working retail full time. Unfortunately there were no degree related jobs or paid internships I could do in my area. Northwest Alabama really sucks. I was unable to do research with any professors because I was having to work full time. I had no financial support from family at all. 

I was married at the time and my ex-husband ruined my credit. He refused to work most of the time and took out credit cards in my name so he could buy worthless shit. I had a couple semesters from hell while getting a divorce and my GPA dropped to 3.47 not awful but it had been a 3.85. 

I hated GIS but was too far in to change my minor because I was running out of financial aid.  We basically just followed outlines from text books. I never felt like I learned what the tools did or why we used certain tools for certain processes or outcomes. Aside from one professor, I could never seem to get the help and teaching I needed. This area is so saturated with GIS grads that even if I liked GIS it would be almost impossible for me to get a GIS job. (I’ve tried.) Grads always get the jobs over those with certificates. The Bio dept did next to nothing to prepare us for an actual career. The classes were so broad and all over the place I feel like I didn’t really learn anything well. We just scratched the surfaces of a lot of things, regurgitated shit for exams, and moved on and never looked back. 

After I graduated, my mother’s health took a huge nose dive. She is disabled and is living with me. I’ve been taking care of her since I graduated. Early this year my brother overdosed and almost died. He moved in, as well. I got him on the road to recovery and he is doing well. Basically, I’ve been everyone’s caretaker the last 3 years. I got remarried and since I was having a hard time finding a degree related job I just picked up extra retail work and helped get my husband through school. He now has an CIS degree and a degree in his field. He just graduated so it’s not very lucrative right now.

Now that neither my mother nor my brother are on the brink of death and my husband has a good job, it’s my turn. It’s time for me to focus on me. I have applied to around 60 jobs in the last 2 months. I have followed up with most of them and I never get a call back. I can’t afford to get any random certifications, taking care of everyone has financially screwed me... again. I thought of getting a Master’s but I haven’t taken the GRE. If I study for the GRE, MAT or PRAXIS I will have to wait til January to take the exam and wait til Fall to go to school because I work so much. I can’t afford to do any sort of coursework that won’t be covered by financial aid. And I can’t afford to do any program that would require me to work less. 

I don’t know what to do. I’m at a complete loss right now. I feel so utterly useless and worthless. My husband’s job is an hour away and he is already a bit tired of the daily drive  back and forth. I just feel like I have no prospects, no hope for a job, no hope for higher education. 100% lost.  

Btw, no one I graduated with who has the same degree and minor has a degree related job (expect two men who had military experience). I feel like I don’t even know anything about Biology anymore. They have all went back to school to get a completely different AS or BS or they teach ESL. Luckily for them they have more familial and financial resources than I do. Aside from ‘stop feeling sorry for yourself’ does anyone have any advice? I am anxiety ridden and depressed over how my life has worked out. I’ve got to get things changing before I can’t crawl out of this pit. 

TL;DR
My life has been working against me and I can’t find a job. Can’t afford a new educational path. I feel like a worthless idiot. Help.",1563858196
65,environmental_science,"Burnt out by the environmental field, are there any other options out there?","Hey guys, 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am finishing my degree in Environmental Resource Management and honestly after working a few work terms with companies I don't see myself in this field at all. I feel like I made a mistake since I don't want to the grind of working in the field of 12 hours per day, crappy hours, contract work or being paid based on the contracts I land. My other dilemma is that my work terms during school were focused on communication, design, volunteer work with youth, administration, safety and then permitting/compliance. So basically I have zero field work experience which I know hinders me a lot in this field. But at the same time I don't want to work in the field and I just don't have a passion like many other students do.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have this dream job or company I want to work for. I definitely don't want to work for Parks Canada (most students want to work there) and I definitely don't want to work fly in/fly out, camp jobs or having to work away from my home location. I definitely am planning on moving out of a city, so that does not matter for me in working in smaller towns or areas that are less developed. 

 

Also my degree does not satisfy the professional requirements to be a P.Ag or RpBio so that is out of the question. It focuses on policy which I have done well in but have no desire to pursue a career in. Don't want to get a masters either. 

&amp;#x200B;

So are there any other post degrees or certificates that I can laterally move out of this field? I was looking into a occupational health &amp; safety, or something that is more stable. It's hard since I feel like there's not much I can do except take another 2-4 year degree which is $$$$. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering if anyone has gone through the same motions and what they ended up doing for work. Thanks!",1563838887

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So I've just switched over into an Environmental Science &amp; Policy major. At my college, the major is very broad and covers a lot of biology, chemistry, geography, ecology and of course, the policy side of things. They also recommend for students to specialize and pick a minor in anthropology, biology, chemistry, earth science, ecology, economics, geography, geology, or political science.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the degree is very broad and that there's tons of places I could go with it. I'm happy for that and that I don't have to fully decide for a while yet. But, the way my mind works I feel like having some sort of goal in mind helps me keep motivated and feeling fulfilled. Right now, I feel like I'm leaning towards something in the realm of sustainable forestry and land management as a career. So, I've got a few questions about that specifically:

&amp;#x200B;

What kind of careers exist specifically in that field?

&amp;#x200B;

What minor should I look at picking up?

I am not sure if this belongs here, but I wonder which of the above products are worse for the environment. I recently switched to a vegetarian diet because of the environmental impact of meat.

Right now I mostly eat meat substitutes and diary to get my proteins for the day. 

However, I have some concerns of my own about eating a lot of soy products (which is often meat substitutes are made of) as they have a high concentration of isoflavones (plant based compound which mimics estrogen), and this is apparently bad for your health as it might reduce fertility in women and affect reproductive health (although there doesn't seem to be a scientific consensus on this yet).

I've read reports that say chicken isn't that much worse for the environment than meat substitutes. I also read that when it comes to diary, cheese is worse than chicken and might even be worse than beef. However, I am confused as to what kind of cheese this concerns. I don't eat a lot of aged cheese but rather a lot of quark/fresh cheese. Is this just as bad? I can't seem to find a good comparison for this.

I want a degree that is more flexible post-grad,  and where I could hopefully have a more stable career doing something I'm just as passionate about. I'm excited and optimistic for the future, but, admittedly, very overwhelmed with how many jobs exist that fall under the umbrella of environmental science and looking for some direction.

What I do know is that I really love being outdoors and I do deeply care about trying to lessen the extent which we're fucking up the planet, and I want to be able to personally see positive change in the places I work to conserve and protect the land.  Worth mentioning is that I feel like I have a specific interest in plants and forest ecosystems, more so even than I do in specifically animals.  I've generally also always felt like most math and analysis type stuff came naturally to me, and generally, was enjoyable enough, for what that's worth. Lastly, money isn't huge on my list of priorities, so long as I can make a living. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is-- what is your personal experience  working in the field, and what kind of jobs are out there?  Do jobs that would let me experience what I'm looking for exist in good numbers or am I confused about the field and setting my hopes too high? How competitive is the job market?

Is a masters program in Climatology worthwhile?

Is doing an environmental science degree internationally detrimental?

I 'll just get it going here and tell you my idea( mind you it is probably flawed, not perfect and I have no idea if it is doable at all) So basically, I m thinking perhaps synthesizing a material similar to plastics but biodegradable should be coming from plants and perhaps imitate some techniques observed in nature.Cellulose occurs in every plant organism and if we could use it to create material it would biodegrade quickly and be less toxic to create than plastic.If it degraded quickly and naturally it would not make it into the ocean and if it was eaten by animals it would not harm them like plastic would.The downside is that this might not be stable enough to make viable ""mock"" plastic bags to use.Perhaps it could be used for wrapping or one time uses like straws on for exsample.Fast growing materials like bamboo for instance are a great first step too.Using it for disposable cutlery or toothbrushes will reduce the use of plastic and Styrofoam.I m not sure if it can be made flexible enough to make food containers, wrappers or cups from though....I also thought about silkworms or spiders for the production aspect.Perhaps weaving with natural materials like they do could be imitated by factories to make natural materials just as durable as plastic by straightening the bonds of each fibre.

What do you think? What solutions do you propose and how could they be used to solve this issue? Let's put our heads together and try to figure it out",1559943594

I graduated about a year and a half ago and except a couple of weeks of fieldwork volunteering, I haven't been able to find a job in my field. I initially hoped to work in wildlife conservation, but i've been applying for any sort of ecology/environment/widlife related jobs, and I haven't gotten a single interview.

I moved to the UK from my home country in October, and sadly had to start working in retail to support myself. This gives me zero time for volunteering (most of voluntary positions I found require the same commitment you'd give to a full-time job, minus covering any living expenses), so I have no idea how to create any connections with people who already work in my field of interest. In a few months I'm doing a month-long EVS placement at a wildlife sanctuary in the UK, but I am honestly reaching a breaking point at this moment. It seems like none of my experience from my home country matters here, and since I never held a job in my field nor have I been a memeber of any organisations in the UK, I think I'm being overlooked. But because I can't find a job, and because I can't do full time volunteering as I need money to live, I can't apply for any relevant memberships or licenses. 

I haven't been able to find a job in my home country due to lack of jobs, and I can't find a job here due to lack of money/experience. Even the entry level jobs seem to want me to have CIEEM (or similar) membership which I don't know how to get as I am currently not doing anything ecology-related. I am attempting to find a voluntary position close to where I live (since i can't afford moving across the country for a job that doesn't pay) that won't require me to devote more than a day or so per week, but no luck so far. I have attempted to pursue a PhD with one of my old internship supervisors here in the UK, but we haven't had any luck in getting the grant (twice). Might try again next year, but I don't have high hopes for that.

What do I do? Is there even any point in trying to pursue a career in biology anymore as it's been so long since I graduated? I feel like potentional employers will take one look at my CV, see I haven't done anything bio-related in over a year, and dump it in the bin.
If it helps, I have a bachelors in environmental science, and masters in zoology.
    
tl;dr 
I have degrees in environmental science/zoology, can't find a biology related job, long-term volunteering is not viable. It's been over a year since graduating and I fear that, amongst other things, being without a job for so long has a negative impact on my applications. Can I fix this, and how?

3.) My University only offers a BA/BS in ""Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences"" (I'm on the BS track). If I just take the engineering courses recommded, would that work for being an environmental engineer? Or would I be better off starting over at another school that actually offers that degree?

I have ~60 credits in cc with classes only as advanced as precalc/trig, chem prereq, physics prereq, with basically all of my other required courses finished.

Not *necessarily* towards humans but to the earth and animals and stuff. I have such broad interests that it's hard to nail down what direction to go in. I've always had an interest in green energy research, geology, and politics. I read and write papers rather well and tend to be passionate about things. 

But that damn **math**.

It's so intimidating. I've always always been horrible in math but excel in basically any other subject. Its bullshit. It's a giant roadblock and I have no idea how I could possibly graduate with a science degree if I cant math. That's half of it.The other dilemma is what do I even really want to do?

98,environmental_science,[Career Advice] I want a job in environmental science-- but I have no background in environmental studies,"tl;dr: I have no background in environmental science. What should I do to qualify myself for environment-related jobs? 

Hi, all. I do realize that there are a lot of career advice-related posts here, but I didn't see one that was relevant while I was searching. 

Here's the deal: I'm 27 and I have a bachelor's from NYU. My work background is in education and content development (I was a teacher and then a content developer for ESL textbooks). However, the idea of continuing down that path for the rest of my life makes me want to bash my head against a wall. I'm currently unemployed and have been really struggling to determine what I want to do with my life. I thoroughly despise teaching, and the idea of writing + editing has absolutely no appeal to me either. When I think about it, the only thing I'm really, truly passionate about or interested in is the environment.

SO, I would like to do a total career change... but neither of my majors was science-related. The fields that interest me the most are environmental science, conservation science, and hydrology... but how do I go about pursuing these with my lack of background? Would the best way be to get another bachelor's degree? Or to do post-bac science and math classes so I can eventually get a master's degree? If I do get a master's, would a non-thesis degree program still be okay, or are those looked down upon? Do any of you know of anyone switched careers with a similar situation? Are there, like, advisor-type people that I should reach out to for help?

My current plan is to basically get any job, start volunteering with environmental organizations in my area, take some pre-req classes if I can, and... then I'm not sure what would be the best thing to do next. I would love any advice that you can give me because I don't really have anyone else I can ask.

7,environmental_science,Career Advice,"Hello! Sorry, I realize that this is posted very often, but this is the most relevant place for this post.

I'm a community college student. I enrolled in a transfer support program when I applied to the school, and one of the requirements is to declare major in the first year, meaning I'm in kind of a rush now.

For a job, I mainly want to do research and design a remediation system for the problems that come up from that, and would love to work mainly on labs. As a career, my long term goal is to open a consultation business for construction work. I don't want to struggle with job security, don't want to be stuck on entry-level positions and I don't want to be rich, but the more money the better.

With that in mind I was set on Environmental Engineering, but after meeting with a counselor I found out I would have to be 4 years in community college with full load before being elegible to transfer. But if I go for Environmental Science I would be there from 2 to 2.5 years. That would be plus the 2 years in Uni. If I go for Env. Science I will add a GIS certification that the college offers, something that could be very difficult with the Env. Engineering workload.

&amp;#x200B;

My short term goal is transferring ASAP and I really don't want to spend 4 years in CC, but I don't want to hijack my career by going to Env. Sciences. Don't get me wrong, I would love to be a science major, but from the internet I have read that Env. Science is focused on research, so its less versatile than Engineering so I won't be designing the remediation, and the average pay cap is lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I wanted to get the opinion of the people in the field, with my goals, which option would be better? As of right now I'm still leaning towards Env. Engineering, but I'm seriously double thinking it.",1556767953

28,environmental_science,Ideas for a Graduate Studies Research Plan,"TLDR: Planning to apply to research-based universities and seeking ideas for an environmental- or sustainability-related research plan

&amp;#x200B;

Hi guys! I am not sure if this is the proper avenue to ask this but I'd gladly delete if not. Just wondering if I could seek help and ideas from you for an environmental- or sustainability-related graduate studies research plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning to apply for a graduate studies scholarship program and eyeing to pursue a sustainability-related graduate program **focusing on one of the key components of the triple bottom line (TBL) sustainability framework** which is the **environment**. One of the application requirement is to submit a research plan of one's interest.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not new to sustainability and my engagement with it at my previous work was in the context of agriculture and measurement/assessment was through ***sustainability standards and certification system*** such as Organic, Fair trade, and sustainable agriculture sourcing or responsible sourcing of farm-based raw materials. I functioned both as a **third-party auditor** and **local consultant**. In the latter, I support raw material suppliers in their compliance with a sustainability code. However, I was not really hands on in implementing a sustainability program.

&amp;#x200B;

The universities in the country where I would apply to are heavily research-based (Japanese univ) and although my previous work experiences exposed me to some contemporary issues in this field, I am not quite sure which specialised area to explore, focus on, study, and where I could actually **conduct research experiments in a laboratory**.

&amp;#x200B;

In the programs that I have been involved in, there are key metrics or performance indicators that would determine whether a raw material has been sustainably sourced or not. What I have in mind or plan to research about is that whether these sustainability programs actually live up to what it sets out to accomplish. I hope that makes sense. Having worked in this, I have observed and got to know that what some businesses (at least in my experience) do are only lip service. I know sustainability takes time. And I sometimes wonder how long it would actually take to see improvement at the grassroot level, in this case, in the lives of farmers who are actually one of key reasons why we push through sustainability. This is one of the areas I want to explore about but does not quite fit a research laboratory set up.

&amp;#x200B;

Would you kindly let me know what you think?

&amp;#x200B;

57,environmental_science,Can you guys give some advice about my future? I'm not sure if I'm in the right path to get what I want,"I'm a Spanish undergraduate in environmental sciences and chemistry (it's a double degree). First of all I'm really not sure about doing chemistry, I like it a lot, but to be honest I don't feel I'm really learning a lot in my university, except for the practice sessions, I don't just go to classes for 2 months and then I just study at home, and I have passed every single course. I feel going to class is a waste of time, except with one amazing proffesor I had (who changed my view on transgenic products, from hate to love).

&amp;#x200B;

If studying chemistry after environmental sciences is good, I'm all for it, but if it's just going to be to get another title and not really to develop good skills, I don't want it. So I'd love your advise on that, I could have done the double degree with Marine sciences instead of chemistry, but to me marine sciences is so related to environmental sciences that I didn't see the point.

&amp;#x200B;

\-And now the most important thing, how I want my future job to be like, I rather not make much money but have free time for myself, I definitely don't want a 9 to 5 job, I don't want to work 8 hours at all. I think  4 to 6 hours is how me and most people are most productive, the rest would just be wasting time, pretending to work.

&amp;#x200B;

I do love environmental sciences, I would love to work on transgenics, and change people views on it, I would want to fight against the idea that a lot of people have that nature is good and humans are bad, climate change obviously, there is a ton of stuff that is exciting about environmental sciences. And the responsability I feel is strong.

&amp;#x200B;

But still, I do want to have a good job, I want to be happy and instead of working for hours, I want to work to be productive, and I think I am that.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, I've become fluent in English, by myself, I haven't paid a single dime on english lessons, I don't see myself working in Spain, I like the climate here, but not society, definitely not education, Norway or Australia seem way better for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going on an Erasmus trip in August to Norway, I'm already learning norwegian, I'm dying to receive a better education there, I'm not sure how that's going to be like though.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you think about all of this? Should I already quit trying to pursue a science career working 5-6 hours per day and do other thing that's going to allow me to live the lifestyle I want to live? 

Do I have the possibility to actually work in other countries or is that really hard? (it seems a lot of people are xenophobic against spanish people)

And about transgenics, could an environmental scientist work on that? Because my professor was a microbiologist, perhaps I should do a master on that instead of chemistry

I'm a rising senior at a top liberal arts college in the northeast, majoring in our Environmental Studies program, and thought for a while that I wanted to be a scientist of some sort, particularly in ecology (I like the applications to agriculture and food systems). However I've always been a pretty creative and artistic person growing up (probably partly what drew me to my school's botanic gardens) but didn't really pursue that route in college, and was always curious about design and building stuff. 

Well now I'm almost done with school, and I still don't feel 100% about being a scientist and am wishing I tried out those art courses. I'm now considering my school's architecture program, because it seems like that would provide be a great way to combine my love of art with sustainability. After working at my school's botanic gardens (as a docent and student researcher), I have a strong belief in the power of public parks and gardens to be multi-functional spaces and thought that I would be interested in researching plant communities, but I've always been curious about how those spaces were designed to be perceived by users and community members, how they are designed to be sustainable in resource-consumption, be low-impact on the natural environment, etc...

After reading up on the major however, I've heard that it's one of the most time consuming majors out there, and that if I were to sign up for it, I'd have to take at least another year of school. I'm a little intimidated by the implied workload, but that's not a dealbreaker. I'd like to get some input out there from people who are in the environmental architecture field/landscape design/etc. and what that field entails, and the kinds of courses you'd recommend. I'd also note that my school does not have a design degree, nor branches into specific kinds of architecture, like environmental architecture, though we are encouraged to cross register at other engineering schools.",1555507724

I am a mechanical engineer and I am working on a thesis where I ll be running a numerical simulation of the following problem. Sewage water is being directly flushed into the sea where I live without being treated. My country also is known to rely heavily on water  from aquifers underground and it was found that this water has been contaminated with E-coli. It has been hypothesed that E-coli intrusion from the coast into these aquifers had taken place. Similar phenomena happens when sea water intrudes into aquifers as well (sea water intrusion) and it is further augmented by the heavy use of underground water. The intrusion of ""salt"" in porous media (or any ionic compound for that matter) is governed by the advection-diffusion species transport equation for porous media.  E-coli intrusion is governed by the same equation in addition to an ""adsorption"" term that's added in the equation which explains other phenomena such as attachment detachment and straining. You don't need to understand what these mean but all you need to know is that this adsorption term hinders E-coli intrusion. For the next step I need to add an equation  -  or a term for the existing equation - that would describe the decay or multiplication of E-coli. Issue is ( and here's where I need some help ), I don't know if E-coli decays or if it is able to multiply in such conditions. I don't know if there are substrates present in the medium. And I don't know if water pressure has an effect on E-coli. My prof isn t of much help and I'm the only one I know who knows about all that stuff.

5,environmental_science,Civil Engineering (environmental focus) considering Environmental Science,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I transferred from a community college in the west to a university in Iowa. When I declared engineering, I didn't really have many of my old credits transfer (I'm a non-traditional student/mom returning to school after an 8 year gap) so I had to start all over. Engineering has been tough and that's mostly because I haven't been balancing myself well with having depression, caring for my family, doing research in an environmental engineering lab, and full-time coursework. I had to retake Calc II and now I have to retake Statics. I do well in my chemistry courses though and I always enjoy my time spent in the lab doing research. My school doesn't offer environmental engineering so I went with Civil with an environmental emphasis. I also have a Civil Engineering internship with the City of West Des Moines in the summer (which I am told by the environmental science advisor could be registered for the environmental science internship course due to the GIS projects I'll be a part of). But I'm not sure if I can handle the engineering courses if I struggle so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I did a degree audit for Environmental Science and noticed that I can graduate in 3 semesters because it accepted most of my credits. I was floored. If I stuck with engineering, I would have to take classes until the end of 2021, possibly going into 2022. When I told family and friends most of them thought I was trying to take an easy way out and tried to convince me to stay with engineering. But when I compare the courses offered by both degrees, I am much more excited about taking environmental science courses like environmental soil and water chemistry, soil and environmental microbiology, a couple GIS courses, and hydrology/hydrogeology. I can even squeeze in a GIS minor. Although my program offers an environmental emphasis, it only incorporates 3-4 environmental courses and doesn't leave any other openings for electives. For civil, I will have to take courses like design of concretes, fluid mechanics, mechanics of materials, structural analysis, and differential equations (oh boy).. which I am not excited about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I scoured this thread for advice but it all points to taking environmental engineering instead, which is not an option for me. In the long run, my goal is to become an environmental scientist or environmental engineering doing work in bioremediation, water/soil resources, or pollution control. Should I suck it up and work harder in Civil because of the job stability? ",1554412717

27,environmental_science,Stuck choosing between UMich SEAS and Duke Nicholas MEM for masters program,"Reposting this thread here - sorry for the inconvenience but I mistakenly left out a lot of important information that could affect some responses. 

----

So my girlfriend has two choices: Duke and UMich for ES grad school. 

**For Duke:** the reputation and name is better in all areas, but also has a very strong presence in ES organizations in Washington DC. It is a program known for great professional development and prepares you well for the professional field. It feels more like a more an ""extension of undergrad,"" with less research experience because the priority is given to PhD students. 

**For UMich:** she likes the area better, the community, the diversity. There is a research component involved and it is likely she will become much closer with the faculty compared to Duke. She spent a couple summers in Ann Arbor and is familiar with the area and already has connections there. She would not only have research opportunities, but also a master's project similar to Duke that gives professional experience through client work.


----

Both are incredibly strong environmental programs, but Duke would likely be better on the resume. However, she is more than willing to choose UMich over Duke if UMich has great prospects outside of the Midwest as well (especially in the DC/MD/VA area). 

She is worried that Duke is more connected with large conservation organizations such as WWF, TNC, NWF, EDF, among others. She's worried that choosing UMich may limit those opportunities. However, even if UMich will remove a few opportunities, that doesn’t mean she’d get a bad job, know what I mean? 

Some people in the previous post talked about how career is more important, but she feels that these jobs immediately after grad school are still influenced by the grad school name, alumni connections, etc.

Anyways we’d love to hear your thoughts. ",1553990298
28,environmental_science,Is University of Michigan reputable when searching for jobs?,"So basically, my girlfriend is choosing Duke vs UMich for masters. 

Duke is better for academics, job prospects, name, etc. Clear choice when it comes to focusing on career. Should be obvious right?

UMich, however, is better for personal passions. She likes the area better, the vibe, the feel. The closeness with faculty and the closeness of the connections. 

We already know how good Duke will be on the resume, but she is more than willing to choose UMich over Duke if UMich has great prospects as well. It’s just she’s too involved in the field and she doesn’t know what the overall ES industry thinks of UMich. Is it a well respected school? Are job prospects just as good? Will she still have a successful career? 

It’s kinda hard to explain but if she comes out of Duke getting a 9/10 job, but comes out of UMich getting an 8.5/10 job... then maybe UMich is worth it anyways. Like maybe UMich will remove a few opportunities but that doesn’t mean she’d get a bad job, know what I mean?

I'm an intern at a soil biogechemistery lab, where I mainly aid one of the Ph.D students in her research on phosphorus cycling in natural shallow water/wetland systems. From what I've done so far (mostly lab stuff, not much field stuff) I enjoy it, although I'd be more interested in focusing more on boreal forests and perhaps from more of an ecology perspective. 

On the other hand, I'm also an intern at a commercial aquaponic farm, and I find plant propagation, especially under controlled environments (Controlled Environmental Agriculture) very interesting. And while my duties vary greatly and this particular farm is very small (doesn't even have glow lights and the greenhouse is more of a hoop house), overall I enjoy it.

I'm torn, because on one hand, I love the outdoors and have a lot of lab experience in soil biogeochemistry, but from several grads of environmental science and related fields I've spoken to, it's a bit harder to find a job. On the other hand, I also like CEA, and from grads of horticulture programs I've spoken to, they are able to find work fairly easily and the industry is growing (the greenhouse manager at the aquaponic farm I interm at doesn't even has a science related degree, which kind of points to there being more jobs than people with related degrees).

75,environmental_science,University of Michigan (UM) SEAS vs. Duke Nicholas School,"Hi everyone! I'm a senior undergraduate student studying Environmental Science and have applied and gotten accepted to these two graduate schools. Degrees would be the Master of Science at UM at the School of Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) and the Master of Environmental Management at Duke's Nicholas School of the Environment.

I was wondering if any of you fellow environmental enthusiasts had any input on these two programs in terms of networking circles, making connections in different regions of the US, types of careers, career salaries, diversity, graduate school communities, school culture, and anything else you might know! 

As of now I've received about equal funding from the two schools though UM has a higher likelihood of obtaining more funding through GSI/GSRA positions. And if I go to UM I probably would be getting two degrees (another in Educational Studies) for a similar tuition cost as Duke's one degree. However I have also spent two summers at UM in a scholarship/fellowship program, am familiar with the campus, and already have connections there but do not have any connections at Duke. I'm really interested in geospatial analysis and wildlife conservation, where I know Duke has lots of opportunities in GIS but I'm not sure how UM compares. Any insights on either program for geospatial and data analysis? In the future, I'm interested in working at a conservation organization (perhaps in the D.C. area) doing a variety of work including geospatial/data analyses, project management, communicating with other organizations, etc and  am not that interested in having a career of majority fieldwork. Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing any of your input on the two programs!!!",1552848848

Second Paragraph is Comprised of Questions for you!

Hi everyone. I'm attending community college at the moment and am majoring in ""Liberal Arts and Sciences - Earth Systems and Environmental Science."" While I'm not entirely sure what I'll be doing years from now as a career, what I do know is that having an outdoors based career is what appeals to me the most (though I don't really know the ins and outs of what an outdoors based career might entail). A career that is indoors / office based would probably drive me crazy as I'm fidgety and always feel the need to move around and enjoy fresh air. What is inspiring me to have an outdoors based career is to have the privilege of enjoying nature while working, to repay Mother Earth for its beauty and sustenance and to make the world a better place. What I don't know much about are actual careers and how many there are, what issues I would like to address, what skills and education I need for those careers, the pros and cons of an outdoors based career, is the career I'm imagining even one that qualifies as environmental science? ... Stuff of that nature (pun intended :) )

What websites do you recommend showcase a vast amount of careers that fall under environmental science? What careers do you all have (and what does an average day consist of?) What environmental concerns do you care about? What inspired you to pursue a career in this field?

This implies the importance of lignin degradation in the coir pith using microbes at various concentration to increase the productivity of enzymes in a short duration of time. Enzymes are unstable proteins which promote chemical reaction in a process. Lignin is one of the major classes of compound that are present in the coir pith. Increased lignin content in the coir pith makes its natural degradation much slower due to the lignin-cellulose complex. [It is very fortunate to imply the use of microbes in the degradation process. Lignin degrading enzymes released as a result of microbial action in the coir pith.](https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/effect-of-various-concentrations-of-lignin-degrading-microbes-for-efficient-coir-pith-treatment.html) The enzymes act as catalysts which are responsible for decomposition. This study helps in the detection of major enzymes as a result of lignin degradation ending in the usage of risk free, pollution free coir pith. This study aimed at the lignin degradation for the detection of lignin degrading enzymes using the fungi such as Phanerochaete and Trichoderma viride. The inoculum concentration of the microbe added in the coir pith was compared for the efficiency and the best treatment with the concentration of microbe was recorded. At the end of the research study, the higher concentration of the microbe produced higher enzyme release in shorter duration. Clostridium treated coir pith was better performing at all the concentrations than Rock phosphate. ",1552107365

The predictive potential of March-April-May rainfall amounts and patterns in Borana Zone also examined using statistical methods. In view of this, multivariate statistical techniques were applied to analyze and predict seasonal rainfall. Global and regional climatic processes induced distinct impact on long rainy season over Borana Zone. [This was also reflected relatively in regional and local climate drivers.](https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/assessment-of-climatic-variability-and-development-of-localized-climate-prediction-method-for-livestock-production-in-borana-area-.html) The results revealed that lag relationship between ENSO and homogeneous rainfall regimes El Niño has strong predictability skill for long rainy season of Borana Zone. Furthermore, the study showed that long rain (March-April-May) has declined while temperature over all season has risen throughout the past consecutive decade. Overall, the results as generated from this study revealed that moderate to severe droughts were recurrent, particularly during the main rainy season, which were predicted well in advance using scientific climate prediction tools., Localized seasonal climate prediction tool would therefore be promising to enhance societal preparedness for various climate-relate hazards by availing timely and local-specific weather and climate forecasts.

12,environmental_science,Action Draft? Thoughts.. Discussion..,"I see room to reduce by 30% minimum. Look at the difference between rail &amp; roads. 4x more than rail (globally). If we build even more public transit rail-lines &amp; reduce car usage, we could cut vehicle contribution in half.

We could also cut residential and business bldgs. contribution in half with mandated and subsidized LEED buildings. Cutting petroleum knocks out 6+% easily, also.

Additionally, if we switch to mandated organic farming and rotation crops for all agriculture we could cut that contribution in half by reducing erosion and petroleum use for fertilizers. Switching to lab grown meat or giving up livestock meat all together would eliminate 5%.

If we reforest 1 trillion new trees in the next 10 years we could easily compensate the 11% from deforestation, and create an additional net reduction from early forest vigor of another 10%.

We've already passed 400ppm. So therefore stopping runaway greenhouse effect will not be possible by stopping our CO2 output. However, we only have 10 years before the runaway effect destabilizes the world utterly.

These measures will ensure we gain an additional 10 years before runaway breaks civilization. 20 years or more should be plenty of time to figure out how to technologically suck enough C02 out of the air to bring it all below 400ppm and then some.

We are so close to disaster, and yet so close to salvation.

As cleanup of an oil spill is usually difficult and expensive, a cost-effective technique for mitigating the excess petroleum hydrocarbon from the environment is of the utmost need. In this study, the ability of the microorganisms isolated from different oil contaminated sites of Bangladesh has been assessed by examining their degradation potential by using heterogeneous hydrocarbon fuels as substrates. [Bushnell-Haas agar (BHA) media was used to isolate and identify the hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria.](https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/assessment-of-hydrocarbon-degradability-of-the-bacterial-species-isolated-from-different-oil-contaminated-sites-of-bangladesh-13337.html) 10 types of bacterial species were grown on the BHA with 1% petroleum hydrocarbon (petrol/octane/diesel) in liquid form as their sole carbon sources. Isolates were incubated in orbital shaking incubator at 37°C for up to 15 days to determine the hydrocarbon degradation capability. Amount of petroleum degradation was identified by gravimetric analysis, a technique by which the amount of a chemical substance can be determined through the measurement of mass. The prominent petrol degradative bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas spp. (58%). In the case of diesel and octane degradation, Bacillus spp. was found to be more effective, 79% and 54% respectively, compared to the other isolates. ",1550748132

Any advice?","Hi everyone, I know this sub is already quite infiltrated with degree questions but i have not been able to find anything relevant to my situation. I have started my first year of University, and because of my high school credits that transferred I will be a junior next school year, meaning I need to specialize next semester. I picked civil because it’s related to the environmental field, and I don’t want an BS in ES due to many advising against it, but I don’t know if i’m on the right track. My hope is to do work in remediation, or sustainability, maybe even being involved in developing new technologies to help our current environmental state. From what it sounds like, environmental engineers mainly deal with quality management, which doesn’t sound terrible but I don’t think it’s what i’m striving for. I need to make a decision, and any advice would be helpful, I love sciences and I would be open to double majors that could benefit me if my current major does not sound ideal for my goals.

Land is one of the most important natural resource and is becoming scarce due to immense anthropogenic pressure. Land use plays a vital role in the earth system: it links human decision making to the terrestrial environment and is both driver and target of global environmental change. However, decisions about how much land to use where and for what purpose and the related consequences are still poorly understood. This deficit is in contrast to the fundamental need for future LULC change analysis to answer pressing questions of future food security, biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation. [The LULC analysis carried out for the study area reveals that the land transformation has primarily been on account of increasing demands of the main city.](https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/dynamics-of-land-use-change-in-ruralurban-fringe-a-case-study-of-srinagar-city-13352.html) The city of Srinagar has not only experienced a simple areal sprawl over the period of last forty years but there have been alarming land transformations among various land use classes. Continuous shift of land from non-developed natural categories to the developed land use is usual affair of urban sprawl but Srinagar City is also characterized by severe land transformations which are in response to the demands of the main City. The rate of transformation has been slow during the first half of the twentieth century but alarming after 1950’s and has now become assumed threatening proportions. ",1550555705

Most vegetables investigated showed high BAF and TF values which varied from one vegetable to the other. This variation might be due to the differences in metal concentration in water and soil, rate of transpiration in plant, nature or chemical form of the metal and age of plants. The health risk index for both metal in both communities were found to be less than 1 which shows that the environment could be considered safe. Although the study revealed no health risk associated with the consumption of vegetables from these environment, caution should be applied in the consumption of the vegetables due to long time bioaccumulation of the metals.

I'm currently working on a product and will have it produced in China. I tried for over one year to find a manufacturer in Europe. However, a) the product is low-tech, b) the order volumes will be small c) we are a new and unknown startup so there is no one really willing to make it here. The price difference for manufacturing is not that large when accounting for import taxes and shipping so I'd be definitely willing to have it produced in Europe.

Our biggest markets will be the US, EU, Canada and Australia, in that order. Since the product will be produced in China, there will be a higher carbon footprint for it than if it were in Europe. We already make sure that essential parts of the product come from within China and not from Europe (e.g., we probably won't use Italian but Chinese cowhide leather). Now, how can we best offset these additional environmental costs when manufacturing in China?

Prior to this I was a dispatcher (shift manager) for a trucking company (all contractors) running freight for a fortune 500 company. This positon paid much better but it was a horrible environment that prompted me to finish school. But I learned soft skills that relate to management, leadership, overseeing large operations, logistics, and working closely with management of client companies.   


I also have:  
Both OSHA 30 hours (Construction/General Industry)  
Occupational Health and Safety certification  
HAZWOPER 40 Hour

&amp;#x200B;

Just applied to take the ASP.

&amp;#x200B;

This is an entry level position and I wholehearted realize that sometimes you have to start on the bottom. I just feel like I am getting great experience if I was going to become a CIH, or a safety manager (neither of which are off the table if worst comes to worst). Not for any type of environmental career.

&amp;#x200B;

This being said, I am continuing my education and looking into Online schools for a BS.

One of the ideas I had was to go for an associates to become Environmental Protection Technician, that way I could get the field experience, get my feet wet and maybe pursue volunteer work, then possibly pursing more education after that, such as a bachelors in environmental engineering.

The other thought I have is, would it be more beneficial to just go into a bachelors program?

I’m also planning to document and create motivational media to help with awareness of some of the major issues in the environment.  I want to make an impact, i want to learn as much as i can so i can create documentaries, blogs and other types of media to help spread awareness of the major issues.

  
I also see a lot of people comment on how its hard to find jobs in specific field, although it is very important to find a job, I'm not very interested in what will lead me to the highest paying thing. I strictly want to learn, and be apart of the movement to find solutions to these major issues

I have been working in the UK for the majority of my career. My girlfriend has an opportunity in Vancouver BC which she is considering and I would be moving over with her. 

So my question is what type of Environmental jobs are on offer in Vancouver,  BC? 

Would work for mining companies be the main source of work?

7,environmental_science,Share your path to finding your career in the hope to help recent grads,"Hello everyone! I just found this board and I'm glad to see that there are a few of us environmental scientists around. 

I've noticed, as many others have, that this sub-Reddit is primarily college students and recent graduates who are looking for info on the Environmental Science field. Hopefully some of the more experienced ES's can help some prospective scientists to better understand what it might take to secure a career in the field. 

As many of you are aware, Environmental Science is a very broad field and I'd like to see what you all do and the paths which led you to get where you are today. 

I am just ""aging out"" of being a recent graduate. I finished up my Bachelor of Science back five years ago and quickly realized that there are a whole lot of environmental science graduates hitting the market every year. When applying to jobs, I also realized that the Environmental Science degree is incredibly broad. I found that many undergrad programs focus on one particular aspect of ES, be it remediation, public policy, ecology, ect. My program was heavily ecology based and I learned that I needed to focus my job searches for ""ecology"" rather than environmental science. 

I ended up working right out of college as an ""environmental specialist"". Essentially, I categorized packaged Hazmat for disposal. I left this job after a few months and decided to go get a Master degree focused in ecological sciences. I then started a seasonal position with a non-profit conservation organization. Non-profit work was fun, but it didn't pay the bills. Most of the work was seasonal as well. 

Once I was close to finishing up the Master degree, I started looking into environmental consulting. There are many forms of consulting as well. Most were soil remediation jobs working on contaminated site clean ups and groundwater sampling. I ended up going a different route and landed a job as a wetland scientist with an engineering company. Here my job was to delineate wetlands and to develop site designs with the engineers to develop building projects while adhering to the Wetland Protection Act, MEPA, and other environmental regulations. 

The job was primarily field work with a healthy mix of permitting and site design. There was alway something different as well. One day I would be documenting vernal pool species with traps and GPS and the next I was sampling sediment from a boat. 

I recently accepted a job offer working for the state Environmental Agency where I'll be investigating wetland/Clean Water Act violations, reviewing site designs, and providing technical review/expertise on development projects which have been appealed to the agency. This position is where I had hoped to end up when I first started undergrad.

In my limited experience, the money is in consulting. One can climb their way up to make pretty well over $100k fairly quickly, however, the higher you go, the less field work you'll have. The work is typically on the land developer's side of the argument, in the sense that you'll be working for developers to abide by the regulations. Not a bad job at all, but you should be aware of that. 

Depending on the state, you can make a good salary in state/federal work as well, though usually not as much as in consulting. I was given a substantial pay raise moving from consulting to state, however, the maximum pay is lower.  

If there was anything I wish I had known when first starting in college, it would be that you need to find a specialty because Environmental Science is such a broad subject. If you want to go into ecology, focus on it and start building contacts. From my experience, the Master degree was absolutely a must and now that I have a handful of years in a specialized field, jobs are much more readily available. 

The environmental sciences, more than likely, wont make you rich, but you can certainly earn a comfortable salary if you so chose to pick a career in some of the specialties. 

Thank you all for reading my text wall. I hope that you all are able to find your career paths and that my experience so far has helped to understand that it often takes some time to get there and that I understand how frustrating and nerve wracking it can be to find a career right out of college. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions and I hope that others will share their experiences in finding their tracks in the environmental sciences!",1545952587

18,environmental_science,Should I switch from Wildlife Biology to Environmental Science (College Major)?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and having a little mid-life crisis. My plan the whole time has been to be a *Wildlife Biology/Ecology major with an Environmental Issues minor* but the stuff I've been hearing in real life and reading on the internet is scaring me. Many people have been talking about how terribly unstable it is and how the pay is terrible. Or how they can't find a job. Is the pay really that bad and are there that few jobs? Struggling to find a job after spending 4 years on a degree does not sound appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole concept of having to find a new job every year sounds terrible, and I don't really have much family or friends to fall back on if things don't work out well. Also the concept of moving from state to state to find a job sounds quite stressful. I suppose I'm willing to do it but a more stable job or at least a stable location would be much better for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also not super outdoorsy, which I'm beginning to realize may be a problem given the seemingly limited amount of jobs out there. I won't get to cherry pick a less outdoorsy job. Don't get me wrong, I like hiking and spending time outside and all that. But a lot of job descriptions have requirements like hiking 15 miles a day or long backpacking trips and that does not sound super appealing, especially as I get older and less athletic. I also cannot swim.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my 3rd of 8 semesters. I could still feasibly switch to an *Environmental Science* major. I'm not as interested nor am I well informed about jobs in the environmental science realm, but the subject still does interest me. Are the jobs any more stable? Is the pay generally any better? Are there still jobs that let you get outside a little bit?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just scared of getting out of college, not being able to find work, and having to wait tables the rest of my life

\-------------------------------

I realize this is a terribly structured post so here are my questions - 

&amp;#x200B;

Main Questions:

1. Are jobs really so unstable and low paying in wildlife biology?
2. Might a switch to an Environmental Science major be a good idea? Is the job market any better and are jobs more stable? 
3. Will jobs in Environmental Science let me get outdoors at all, or do they tend to be more desk jobs?
4. How necessary is grad school for Environmental Science? I will have 0 debt coming out of college maybe that will make going to grad school easier.

I'm just looking for any advice and tips about Environmental Science jobs, especially if you are someone who can compare ES and wildlife biology",1545634762

I have an engineering degree (electrical) with 2.5 years experience and i’m also miserable. I wanted to do environmental science when i went to college but my school didn’t offer it so i randomly chose engineering. I’m looking to get out of that field altogether due to said misery.

I met a guy on the appalachian trail who was an environmental scientist, and he said his job involved taking water and soil samples from somewhat remote locations, and that he would often turn the field work into an overnight hiking/camping trip. i believe he said that he worked for Dow chemical (and he quit because he felt dirty working for them but otherwise loved the job).

this sounds like a dream job to me, and i’m wondering if it actually exists. and i’m also wondering if there’s any chance i could get one of those jobs with an engineering degree and a tiny bit of experience in that field.  i know my degree is largely unrelated, but i see some ES job postings that say “Degree in Environmental Science or related science”

53,environmental_science,"Please, ask me questions! I need to know if ENV SCI is right for me as a prospective grad student (and ultimately, career-wise).","Evergreen College in Olympia, WA has a Masters of Environmental Studies program. Deadline to apply is approx one month from now. I've thought about it, over and over, and seek some input from others if it's right for me (I have posted here before). Some things I like about the program: it's largely interdiscplinary, giving you several different angles on how these environmental issues are interconnected between different orgs &amp; individuals. It also allows for a good amount of independent work, where studies can work with faculty to answer their own Q's. It's relatively cheap and flexible.

I graduated with a B.A. in East Asian Studies (Japanese semi-fluency) 7 years ago; my background in science is minimal. Over the last 1.5 years I've done a little avian ecology work, volunteered for the Audubon, zoo, etc. Nothing super immersive other than the 1-month internship in Ecuador for avian ecology.

Here's what I know: a lot of my interest in this field revolves around Animal Behavior. I also think birds are pretty fascinating (certainly some overlap here). I also consider myself a realist -- Global Warming + declining animal species counts really alarm me, and I find it likely that I would get a lot more fulfillment in working towards these real issues than something like sports analytics (last 3 years), which in fact, doesn't matter outside of the tiny world that it operates within. I know that I'm good at asking the right questions, have a pretty good ear/eye in the field, and would also be interested in doing some collaborative work between US-JPN as it might involve a bi-lingual component. 

Here's what I also know, leading to some dissonance: I've never been naturally keen on hiking or camping, esp. alone. Nature walks never intrigued me until I started taking an interest in birds. Science courses never grabbed me growing up, and I spent most of my years in school coasting, incl. college (I did earnestly learn when studying abroad). I think it's important for me, in general, to have a decent amount of balance, so spending all my time in the field doing point counts or all my time with an excel sheet in an office would both get to me. I may want to limit my collegiate and professional experiences to WA state, at least as much as possible. I'm also not sure that focusing on *just* avian conservation would sit right with me, as there are so many other organisms in dire need of assistance right now.

Any questions like: ""are you willing to ____? Do you enjoy ___? What are you hoping for with ____?"" may ultimately help in my decision.

One of my professors recommended that I look at a program from the University of Minnesota that would combine the two fields. https://www.hhh.umn.edu/masters-degrees/master-science-science-technology-and-environmental-policy

I am fearful that I would not be able to get a job out of college with this masters. After trying to get work within politics or a political science related field I have learned it is really difficult and full of nepotism. If you dont know people, you will not succeed. 

I love policy stuff and it comes very natural to me, science does not. I have decent enough grades where I should be able to get into the humphrey's school for this program, as long as I dont bomb the GRE. 

So, do you think it would be better to have a B.S. in environmental science or a M.S. in environmental science public policy? 

To me it seems that my ceiling is higher with the M.S., but that I would be looking to fight over only a handful of positions in my state (Minnesota). 

With the B.S. I might be limiting myself, but if I wanted to go into policy still I can as I still have the poly sci degree, but that degree doesn't seem to have much value anywhere, to be honest. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Or, if you happen to know of any other resources or people I can speak with, I am trying to get a better understanding here and that is difficult without having years in the field.

I have some chemistry background, but nothing too advanced.

Does anyone have any suggestions on where I could look, or at least a point in the correct direction?

Would a degree in environmental science with a minor in statistics or computer science or business analytics be a good route to change to?  I have taken up to calculus 3, and consider myself good at math, so I am not afraid of learning stats and programming to complement this education.

Does this seem like a legitimate route, or am I just romanticizing the possibility of working with birds? I'm guessing that it might be a bit of both. **On top of this for those of you who have completed a major in environmental science with a minor in statistics or computer science, how hard was it to get a job out of college?**

78,environmental_science,Environmental scientist trying to map out the next step of my career.,"Hello knowledgeable people!

Here is some background:

I am a environmental scientist, I graduated 2016, I work for a small consulting firm for nearly 2 years now. I am primarily in the remediation sector, groundwater/soil sampling. I enjoy the work, which is almost all field work, 6/10 satisfaction, mainly because I have been doing the grunt work. I am going to be graduating to higher level work soon and I need some advice about where I should go from here.

1) I am concerned about my future in the consulting field because I am not a geologist (PG) or a environmental engineer (PE) and therefore I feel my career is in some way limited unless I go back to school and get a second bachelors in environmental engineering. NEPA is where my firm is moving at the moment and I have only written a few small sections of chapters 3 and 4. **Anyone here in love with NEPA?** 

2) I am exercising the idea of finding full-time federal employment. I get referred for temporary employment opportunities but I am not certain I want to drop my full time job for a temporary one which is less pay. My biggest question is who can explain why the Bureau of Labor Statistics says you make on average $101,400 ([https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/environmental-scientists-and-specialists.htm#tab-5](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/environmental-scientists-and-specialists.htm#tab-5))? I am not only for the money but if I am comparing federal employment to consulting (and the cost of going back to school to qualify for a PE) only to make on average $86,800 ([https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/environmental-engineers.htm](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/environmental-engineers.htm)).  **Does anyone know where this average federal environmental scientist salary comes from?**

CO2 has a specific gravity higher than 1. 1 is the specific gravity of ‘air’.....if the greenhouse gases are heavier than air then they will fall to the surface of the earth, simple physics.

75,environmental_science,"BA or BS, does it matter to employers?","Hello,

  
I am starting school in January to pursue a degree in Environmental Science at UF. Here is the program information:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGNTR/EVS\_BA\_BS/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGNTR/EVS_BA_BS/)

&amp;#x200B;

They have a BA and BS option. It seems the only difference between the two is that to graduate with a BS, I would need to take math up to Calculus 2 and physics up to Physics 2. Also, you take a little more science classes with the BS option as opposed to more environmental policy/society courses with the BA. I don't want to struggle through these classes if I don't have to and I am hesitant to take these classes because I've been out of school for quite some time.

77,environmental_science,Minor to compliment my Major,"Hello, I am currently pursuing an Environmental Science degree in college. It is time for me to choose a minor and I am interested in a few areas.
My main career goal is to work as an agent for the Department of Fish and Wildlife, or in some capacity as a park ranger. I am trying to choose a minor to compliment my major in a way that would help me find a job in one of those fields. But also one that could keep my options open for maybe the Department of the Interior or Agriculture.
I am looking to choose between a Communications or Criminal Justice minor. I figured if half of a ranger's job is to communicate with the public and the other is law enforcement.

81,environmental_science,I switched jobs 3 times in 6 months and that's OK," So I'm writing this post as a means of encouragement for those who are just starting out in the environmental science field, or who just plain aren't very happy at their current position. This will probably be pretty long so I'll try to put a TL;DR at the end for you. As a word of caution: do I necessarily recommend switching jobs so often? Not really, but your life has many paths you can take to happiness and hopefully this is mine.   


To give some minor backstory, I graduated in May with an environmental geoscience degree from a large university in Michigan with an ""environmental technician "" job offer in metro Detroit.   


Out of 30+ job applications I put in during the last 8 or so months of school this was my only offer I received and it was $15 an hour ""guaranteed"" full-time. This job definitely wasn't my first choice, but the pay was decent and I really didn't have any other options. Bills don't stop needing to get paid, this is something I'm sure everyone can understand. I trained for roughly 3 weeks and was lucky enough to have my company get me 40 hour HAZWOPPER training in Ohio, all expenses paid. After the training I jumped into work to find out that it was heavily industrial hygiene-based, and definitely not something I was super interested in. Alas, I needed money and professional experience. When I accepted my job offer I was told it could be up to 50% travel within my region (Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania), but they would try to work with their employees. I quickly learned that if I wanted to get 40+ hours a week I would have to travel constantly and spend Monday-Friday out of town. I have a fiance and having an ever-changing schedule with crazy amounts of travel wasn't a great way to continue building our relationship.  On top of that, why am I paying rent for an apartment that I'm only getting to spend 4-8 days a month at  


About two months into the job I began searching for something else that I was more interested in and would require less travel.   


Fast forward to the beginning of August and I'm now starting my current job, working as a ""field tech"" for an environmental company; subcontracting into the paint booth at a manufacturing plant for a big 3 auto company for $18 an hour, \~48 hours a week. So in about three months of working I was able to get a $3 raise and find a job that I thought I would enjoy.  


For about the first month at this job it wasn't too bad. My schedule was Monday-Thursday, 12 hour shifts with the possibility of working on Sundays if the plant needed to run production. On the plus side I get majority 3-day weekends and get to sleep in my own bed every night. On the other hand, 12 hour shifts are definitely very long and leave you almost no free time after your drive home and shower/have dinner. About a month into the job my shifts were changed from Wednesday-Saturday and things started to go downhill again. In theory I still had my 3 day weekends, but in practice, if all of your friends/family work Monday-Friday, and your SO works Monday- Friday, you end up spending almost no time with any of them. Most people don't want to hang out on Sundays, and after 4 days of 12 hour shifts you just want to sleep in and do nothing on your first day off. 

Fast-forward again to about the beginning of October, and I'm contacted by a large design and consulting firm that I had applied to around the same time I got the offer for my current job. After going through the interview process I was offered a position as an ""environmental technician"" position at $21 an hour, and I've been told I'll be doing mostly low-flow water sampling (wells) and some vapor sampling. I'm told I'll be working mostly 40-45 hour weeks; mostly Monday-Friday and \~25% travel. 

To be honest I'm not entirely stoked about the thought of more travel, but they seem a lot more organized than my first job, and they have environmental scientist as well as geologist positions in their mid-level openings. So overall I'm pretty excited.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I graduated in may with my environmental geoscience degree and had two jobs that I haven't really liked for various reasons I've consistently been getting offers for more money at every stage and I'll be starting a third job in a couple weeks at a company that I'm pretty sure I'll enjoy, doing work that I'm actually excited about. Moral of the story is that if you're not happy with the job you currently have, there's no shame in looking for something different.",1540594252

The water resources planning jobs pay well at municipalities where i am (So.

96,environmental_science,"Environmental Science, Forestry, or Wildlife Conservation Biology?","Sorry, I hate to fill up your subreddit with another degree post. I did search and found something similar but not close enough for me to feel secure about it.

It's my understanding from what I've read anything that has to do with biology is pretty much a bad decision due to the crazy amount of people with biology degrees.

I was wondering if someone wouldn't mind helping me weigh these options.

On one hand, we have Forestry(I'll just go ahead and disclose the schools to help your opinion) offered by the University of Kentucky. This is the exact major I want but it comes at quite the price (about 20,000 a year, 10k more a year than the next option)

The second is Murray State University (also in KY) and this is the place with the two other options. I can choose Environmental Science or Conservation Wildlife Biology. The latter encompasses some core classes of the forestry degree but has biology attached to it. The former isn't too far off what I want to do because I wouldn't mind working in Geology at all. 

The biggest thing here I think is the money which Murray State wins in. I feel UK probably has more connections but are those connections worth $40k over 4 years? (Also, I'd like to add to save you a google maps search. Murray State is RIGHT NEXT to a national recreation area called Land Between the Lakes. Also at Murray State, since I'm paying so much less for my BS a Masters is definitely an option


All these degrees sound great to me, so I'm just looking for some opinions. I have already submitted my application to UK and plan to do so to Murray as well and make my final decision later on down the road.

Sorry, you won't see another s-post from me until I'm desperately trying to get my homework done I swear!!! (kidding)

Final thought:
Since it may be valuable information to some these are the type of careers I'd like:
Anything that involves working in a National Park doing some level of scientific work (Even Park Ranger, I'm fine with working my way up the ladder)
Anything that involves travel
Oh and not to be picky, anything that literally involves the wildlife (save being homeless in the wildlife)",1539736931

41,environmental_science,Pursuing environmental career in Canada - good education but no experience!,"Hi!

I’m looking for advice about getting into the environmental science field in Canada - more specifically BC, Alberta and/or Ontario.

I received my BSc in Biology in 2012 focusing on areas like conservation, biometrics and aquatic ecology - my undergrad thesis was on studying lake sediment turnover and ghg emissions.

Took some time off from school (working mostly to make money and figure out my next move), then just finished my MA in Geography with my thesis in sustainable agriculture and labour. Among TAing for stats and intro geography courses,  I did some teaching and research assistance in community engagement/interdisciplinary pedagogy as well as placed highly in an ag/finance federal policy competition.

Now that those are all wrapped up, my wife and I are looking to get into career mode, more specifically to the provinces mentioned above. 

I believe with my experience in these areas of research, I’m suited to environmental consulting or policy research but I have some concerns, namely: 

- Skills: though I have applicable degrees I don’t have a lot of hands on skills, I.e. Didn’t touch GIS in my MA, any lab skills in my BSc are from 6 years ago and haven’t been  utilized since.
- Experience outside of academia. I have some lab work but that was mostly assistance in a animal facility at a uni. Did some community engagement through volunteering with different alt. ag/food security/food centres.

This leads me to general requirements for job postings, I tend to see membership to biologist associations or, being qualified to be a member as a requirement for a lot of job postings. The chicken/egg dilemma is that memberships seem to require years of experience in the field/sector?

Basically, my issue is I feel I have a strong resume from the academic side of things but when it comes to applicable skills and work experience, I’m lacking. At this point I’m not sure how to make my next step and I feel like starting a career is nigh impossible despite all my hard work.

If anyone has any advice or insight that would be greatly appreciated.",1537804143
42,environmental_science,Looking for Career Advice,"I actually posted in this sub not long ago asking about a Certificate program, but recieved no replies. This time I'm just gonna ask for general career advice. I'm a recent college graduate with a BS in environmental science. I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm working full time as a land surveyor for an engineering firm, but in order to really go anywhere with that, I'll need to go back to college and get a PLS, which I don't want to do. I would prefer to do something more related to my major. I applied to pretty much every job on Indeed that was relevant, plus some on Monster and the North Carolina government job site. The only company I heard back from was the on I'm working for now. I'm worried the experience I'm getting here won't help my future job prospects, as I'm not sure it will be relevant. Like I said in my other post, I'm considering getting a Certificate in either soil science from NC State or EHS from NC A&amp;T, leaning towards soil science because I interned in the EHS field and am not sure that's what I want to do. I'm not sure if I should keep looking for a job now or just try to get experience here, because I don't want employers to see my doing nothing for months after graduating or see me as flaky for quitting a job after a few months. I'm also not sure if the Certificates will really help. Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.

So my question would be, is this something that I should try out just to get my foot in the door? The association has other departments that I could possibly apply to and move to another position at some point but it’s not guaranteed and it’s also not guaranteed that those positions would involve field work or research.

60,environmental_science,Asking for Advice: Moving up in environmental work,"TL;DR: what advice would you have for someone trying to move up into a permanent position in research work (wildlife focus) or moving into consulting.

So I graduated with an environmental science degree in 2017 with minors in biology and geospatial technologies.
After which i had a really tough time finding an environmental job and ended up as a animal technician for UNC, which is a glorified name for being underground 24/7 doing lab rat animal husbandry. Did this for 6 months.
That finished and I got lucky in emailing a grad student about whether or not his tech position was still open right when a tech quit. Worked in avian radio telemetry and vegetation surveying for another 5 months.
Now I'm trying to get another position, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding anything that's a step up. I have bills to pay and I could really use getting benefits as I will be off my parents life insurance soon as they retire(I know I am lucky to have had it so long). I can't seem to find jobs looking for someone with my experience that's permanent and moving up in research and environmental work.
I'm looking more into environmental consulting, as I would be fine with water, air, soil testing. Especially if it has any biology/ wildlife work. I just want to stay away from the asbestos and factory/ plant testing. I don't know, wildlife is my passion but it just seems like a hole to me.

74,environmental_science,Hi I'm currently in the process of applying for environmental science BSc Hons. Applying for my foundation year and..,"I'd like if someone could do a once over on my personal statement and give me some feedback.

Change the world, save the planet. Innovation is what is needed in sustainable energy, improve ideas already implemented and adapt to the transition that is beginning at a snail's pace. Lithium ion, solar and wind are the base ideas. But where could these ideas go? What possibilities can we see in our future? The Inevitably ending fossil fuels needs to be swapped out before we run out. This is where I come in, my first foot in the door. My first step into learning of how to save the planet and ultimately the future. How can I improve my knowledge, broaden my horizons and learn all I need to know about Environmental sciences. Pursue my dreams and open my mind. To sustain our future, we have to pioneer sustainable energy. I believe yesterday is the time to start, so instead today is the day to make the change. In two hundred years we have used over 3 quarters of fossil fuels and with demand on the rise I fear for the next generations after us. How will my children and grandchildren live in the future? Will they see the end of humanity caused by global warming. Will I? I like the movie the day after tomorrow, I wouldn’t like to live it.

Given the opportunity to learn I will. I have a passion for the sciences, taking an NVQ level two in exercise and fitness to broaden my own knowledge. The books I read soaked in the information as if my brain was a sponge. Consisting of anatomy, human biology and physiology. With a basic background of knowledge in the core sciences and even some geographical science. This would be a great foundation to build on and learn the key skills for environmental science and push my mind to the maximum. A seminar predominantly about recycling management first peaked my interest in the environment. As I've aged my intellect has stayed yet my knowledge has grown. The say you can’t learn wise, it comes with time but for every individual that time is different.

With a basic background and youth in engineering and mechanics, growing up helping my dad fix cars and studying in school. I have a strong understanding in the workshop and adapt and learn to the environment around me. I am a focused and driven with any given task. Showing planning skills, leadership and solitary work. It is also essential and a great benefit for myself and others to work together, whether that be sharing ideas and thoughts to aiding in tasks and sharing methods. It is best to have high organization skills as this is to aid in productivity, planning and even in management. A project I worked on building benches for a charity garden consisted of planning as a team, splitting into smaller teams to start manufacturing then back to a full team for assembly. All achieved by organization skills.

I like to stay up to date with current affairs, I always have my head stuck on some news site or in a newspaper. But I’m a tech bug at heart. Anyone who knows me will tell you I will always have something in my hand usually alongside with a screwdriver. How does it work? How can I get it to work better? Then there's the computers, Christopher will fix it is a term commonly used. I like to tinker. Then there are the common tropes I love to play PlayStation. It’s nice to switch off and socialize. But I still like to learn usually following the latest in the media in the science world, Elon Musk comes to mind. Dubbed the real Iron Man. It truly wouldn't surprise me if he came flying out in an iron suit, but I’d bet my life it was battery powered.

75,environmental_science,Struggling to find the right search terms for a project my advisor wants me to work on,"Hello everyone, 

I am a graduate student studying organizational deliberation in the U.S. My area of focus is higher education organizations, but my advisor does a lot of environmental deliberation research. As many of you probably know, grad students need to work with their advisors and sometimes this means doing work that we don't really know anything about. That is the case with me today, as I am currently trying to find articles that would explain one of the behaviors that we observed. Last year my advisor collected some data on public deliberation of USFS fire treatment strategies in a small rural community in the U.S. In short, the qualitative data demonstrated that a very small number of people were very vocal (and against) a USFS treatment plan, but the majority of folks in the community supported the plan (based on a survey of 35% of the total town's population). I am trying to locate environmental articles that speak to this. Essentially, I'm looking to find research that highlights how a vocal minority can sometimes play a significant role in influencing environmental policy at a local level. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is I have used terms like ""environmental justice"" ""squeaky wheel"" ""environmental deliberation"" ""environmental policy"" ""local environmental activism"" and others, but have yet to come across any articles that really discuss this particular point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if anyone here had any search suggestions, or if anyone here has come across research that touches on the aforementioned phenomenon.

""some think that the CEP is harder to get than the PE and means a lot more to professionals in the environmental field. But the PE, with it's reputation means more to others and other engineers."" 

We work in a engineer dominated environment, a male dominated environment. As a female this is hard enough without my boss telling that my goal is considered second to my co-workers. And what's stopping me from getting my CEP after my PE. I feel like I would have a better chance.

79,environmental_science,Environmental policy vs. data analysis--stuck between two roads,"Hi all! I recently graduated from a great university, but I can't shake the feeling that if I knew going into college what I know now, that I would've taken a completely different route. I also can't figure out how to find a position that is what I truly want. I know that you won't have the perfect job when you graduate--trust me--but I have trouble pursuing things that I don't take enjoyment in. 

I had a great deal of trouble for the first 2 years in college deciding what I wanted to pursue. Everything I wanted to pursue, I was terrible at. Not the kind of terrible where people tell you ""oh, you'll get the hang out it!"", but the kind of terrible where people say ""no honey, there is something else you MUST be better at"" as they slowly pat you on the back. They were absolutely correct in saying this: it took me 3 tries to finally pass chemistry II--with a 1.7.

I wished that I was better at writing--but I'm not. I don't understand subject:verb agreements and no matter how many edits I do or receive, I can't escape passive voice. It drives me up the walls and even if I notice it, I can spend up to 30 minutes fixing one sentence alone and get so frustrated that I can't even look at the assignment for a few days. It's frustrating because I know I can tell a good story. I just don't know how to do it the ""right"" way. So majoring in communications was off the table.

Anyways, I ended up pursuing a BA in Political Science and a BS in Environmental Science. I fucked my GPA to the top taking those classes that I desperately wanted to be good at until I found these two fields in which I was actually pretty good at. I have an incredible passion for the outdoors, and my affinity for interpersonal skill is really helpful here, as most wildlife biologists have trouble communicating their ideas in ""layman's terms"". Great, GREAT researchers, but not so skilled when it comes to bringing back the research to places where it can be understood--aka the general public and government.

But during my time in college, I spent a lot of time pursuing internships where I performed research and data analyses. Found out it isn't all of math I'm bad at--I was the best student out of 250 in statistics! GAME-CHANGER! I then realized I'm actually really great with data processing using different programs, and thoroughly enjoy it as well. However, this doesn't hit me until \~2 quarters until graduation. I don't have any more time to take any classes that build on this skill, and I've already spent 5 years balancing two jobs, internships, volunteer opportunities, and school. The thought of more classes sickens me to the core, despite my love for learning.

So, here I am. I have two degrees which would essentially pair together well for environmental policy/science communication, although my writing is garbage and I don't know how to fix it because I hate writing when it's not required. I do quite enjoy it when I see a purpose for the piece, though. I also really enjoy data analysis, but I am not skilled in any language, nor have I taken any formal classes on a single program, so that is off the table with jobs as well. If I could start over, I think I would get a single degree in environmental sciences with a minor in quantitative sciences (essentially, statistical biology) and an emphases in some of the data programs I like. But, it's obviously too late now.

I just don't know what to do. I feel overwhelmed and like I just messed it all up. I wish I had more guidance before and during college. I'm absolutely terrified about being broke my whole life, as I have barely made it out alive as an independent college student. I have hopes that I will get hired as a research associate for environmental policy, then go on to get an MPA and become a policy analyst, although I can't get the data analyses out of my head. I really enjoyed it, but I couldn't imagine doing it for my whole life. I couldn't imagine doing policy for my whole life either. Is there a position that mixes the two? 

Do any of you resonate with this at all? How did you move forward? 

\*\*TL;DR: How much of an overlap is there in the field between data analyses and policy making for a single position? If there isn't much, how can I decide which path to pursue?\*\*

I was also planning to complete an AAS in geospatial technology in the spring, with the intent of finding a GIS job, which I could then leverage as experience into a more specified environmental engineering job down the road.  However, due to a class being cancelled this semester, it is looking unlikely that I will actually finish the GIS program.

MSc in environmental science with a thesis on environmental impact assessments (Australia).

I am very conscious of becoming over qualified, but this is a free course! It's too good of an opportunity to pass up. 

Desired industries to work in the next 5/10 years:
Environmental consulting
Mining (office based and not fly-in, fly-out)

Any advice would be taken on-board with the decision making.

9,environmental_science,High gas readings at a landfill have me stumped.,"I know the odds of finding a landfill gas expert on this site is rare, but I'm hoping someone here might have more knowledge than I do since research on landfill gas is few and far between. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a site that has had CH4 exceedances on-and-on for years. The exceedances are now at concerning levels (20-40% methane by volume), so I am trying to remediate. One probe in particular has had issues the longest. It has passive vents both in and out of waste, a soil vapor extraction system hooked up to a flare, and even a gas interceptor trench surrounding it. Daily monitoring is performed at this probe as well as surrounding probes, groundwater wells, and structures to check the CH4 levels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago the probe in question had high concentrations of CO (\~400 ppm) and H2S (500+ ppm) along with 42% methane by volume. I immediately evacuate the area and go in to investigate. I check all nearby probes, wells, structures, and even the ambient air. Only this probe is having the high concentrations of CO and H2S. I check the entire landfill for signs of an underground fire (cracks, dead grass, odor, smoke, etc.), and no signs of a fire are found. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that decomposition can produce CO and H2S, but I've never seen it at concentrations this high in a probe \~500 ft. away from the waste. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone on here know what could be causing high CO and H2S levels other than natural decomposition or a fire? ",1535552017

58,environmental_science,Help me decide: Master in Environmental Science or Environmental Engineering.,"Hello Everyone! So I've recently gotten accepted into a couple of Canadian universities that offer Masters in Environmental Science and in Environmental Engineering.

A bit about myself. Graduated last years with an BSc (Honours) in Environmental Science and have done an internship with an international environmental consulting firm that does Environmental Site Assessments plus some volunteering with Environmental conservation authorities. I really enjoyed what they do and decided to pursue a career in the ESA, contaminated land, soil remediation field.

Doing masters is challenging for any degree in my opinion but I would say I am average at math and the thought of doing Masters in Environmental Engineering some times scares me as this is more applied knowledge and I fear that I will have a more challenging time there as my colleagues have already covered their fundamentals and have a good background in engineering from their bachelor years.  I've looked at the course outlines, they are interesting courses but seem challenging and I don't think I will be able to get top notch grades. 

I feel like I will get much better grades from my Masters in Environmental Science since I'm familiar in this area. I plan on taking the coursework + a research project related to my field of interest to get more experience. 

PS: I want to pursue a career rather than going to the research/academia side after completing my masters.

TL:DR: I like both programs. Masters in Engineering will be challenging as I have not covered the fundamentals and will probably do average if I take this route. Masters in Environmental Science is also a good option and will be relatively easier for me to obtain good grades. ",1533651256

1) Can i get a decent job with just an associates degree. I'm 23 and id really like to be able to get a full time job in the field once i'm finished with the degree. Continuing my education for a bachelors may be something id do in the future.

2) when i say decent job i mean like decent conditions and pay, not working weekends. Basically a 7-3 or 9-5 job Monday through Friday. - I don't really want to do manual labor with this job. I understand that there may be a little at points in every job. but basically, i don't want to be digging trenches and doing manual labor.

3) Another thing is. When i search for science jobs. many say a degree in Chemistry biology or env science. i guess what im asking is, can i get a chemistry type job with a degree in env. science?

4) bottom line is, ive done manual labor before and i dislike it. I don't want this to be a career where i'm cleaning up hazardous chemicals and spills etc.. i want it to be a career i can eventually have a well paying job in. Doing minimal dirty work. So if that isnt really possible with an associates degree id appreciate some input on that.

73,environmental_science,Environmental Science major in need of career advice,"Howdy, I’m an undergrad Environmental Science major at Texas A&amp;M University. I graduate with my B.S. in December of this year. I’ve been thinking for a year what kind of job I want. I don’t know any professionals in my field, only fellow students, so I’ve come here to ask some career questions.

I’ve looked far and wide, and there are a lot of Environmental Science jobs in Texas, but I’m also considering other options. Here are my specific questions:
1. Glassdoor says the average salary for an Environmental Scientist in the United States is $54,000 a year, however something tells me Glassdoor is full of it and I’m going to be making $35,000 a year and that really scares me. Is this fear legit?

2. “Environmental Scientist” seems to be a lot more of a vague phrase than I thought. Some places want you working out in the field, others only want you in the lab more like an Environmental tech, some want you to do both, and some seem to say Environmental Science and Environmental Engineering are the same thing. Is there a “usual” description of what an Environmental Scientist job is?

3. Are there any opportunities to make 6-figures in this field? I’m hoping that eventually moving up to management would do this, but I’m concerned I’ll be down in the 30s, 40s, and 50s for a very long time.

4. Part of me wants to apply to be a Texas State Trooper because (I also really like law enforcement) and the pay after the first year is about $74,000, and swiftly moves up after that, plus state benefits. My dad is trying to convince me that I’d be better off sticking with my degree in the private sector. I get money isn’t everything, but if I had to choose between making $50,000 until I’m 45 and working in my field, or possibly having the chance of being a Texas Ranger one day, I would lean towards the latter.

I hope none of this came off as arrogant or too blunt. I don’t really have anyone to talk about these professional concerns with. I understand money isn’t everything, but it is at least something. If you managed to get through my paragraph-styled questions, I’d be much obliged if you could offer some advice.

Thanks!

Just wanted to get some thoughts on what areas you think might be the most promising for large scale carbon sequestration, and some possible career suggestions for breaking into that space.

My initial interest is in using algae (both macro and micro) to take carbon of the atmosphere directly.  Seems like something that is pretty well established in terms of deployment, and has a lot of uses for the end product.  The problem there is that depending on the use, it is carbon neutral at best.  I've been considering looking at using the algae for bioplastics, or perhaps methods of bioenergy production that have a carbon negative aspect.  There is also possibility for use for animal feed, which can reduce methane emissions, but again, this is just a reduction, not a sequestration.

The other one that interests me is concrete production, and figuring out ways to make that process carbon negative.  I've seen some companies that work in that realm, but the one in my area seems to only have a reduced carbon footprint, not actual carbon negative.

So does anyone know what the most promising tech out there today is for carbon sequestration at a large scale, or have any thoughts on the two technologies mentioned above? Also, what are your career/educational suggestions for working in this realm?",1532269937

Hydrology isn't an option(although I know a place for an internship) but I could try and get some small amount of course focus in the geo tract. I wish it was though, I am very interested in water work (limnology, hydrobio, chem, and microbio) but then I go rocks and soil are really interesting (pedology, edaphology, chem, and geomicrobio).

88,environmental_science,Environmental Engineering? Conservation? Confusion?,"Hey, so from what I've read online is that most environmental engineers are involved in waste, water and air pollution management. I volunteered for a turtle conservation project before and that kinda opened my eyes to ocean pollution and the animals threatened by environmental pollution :( So, I really wanna help the environment and the animals. I have a few questions...


1. Is it possible for environmental engineers to go into the conservation field? Or are there any other recommended fields that I could look into? I enjoy fieldwork and the outdoors.


2. Can an environmental engineer major work in an environmental studies major job? 


3. I'm planning to do a study abroad in Europe. Which of the countries are better for environmental engineering? I heard Germany's good for engineering but Spain's good for environmental related majors? Other suggestions welcomed!


4.  Have any of you done an internship or are currently working in Alaska? What is it like working there? 


5. Also, the salaries for environmental engineers are really low compared to other engineering majors. I'm not that money minded but I worry I won't be able to survive even mediocrely. Any feedback is welcomed and appreciated! 


6. Could it be possible that it's harder for a female environmental engineer to find a job?


Thank you so much! I really appreciate your advice and feedbacks. ",1532230954

98,environmental_science,Solutions for the garbage mass in Pacific?,"I hope this finds you well.

A little idea I had

Pestalotiopsis microspora is a species of endophytic fungus capable of breaking down and digesting polyurethane. Originally identified in fallen foliage of common ivy in Buenos Aires, it also causes leaf spot in Hypericum 'Hidcote' shrubs in Japan.


We could use Pestalotiopsis and oyster mushrooms to break down the  massive land mass of garbage in the Pacific ocean.  Can be achieved possibly with the use of thousands of remote controled drones dispatched from large ships. Each would carry a payload of spores or mycelium cakes that they would  drop off at various points on the landmass. Large operation but achievable nonetheless. Landmass could eventually be an ""arbor harbor"" where could we plant large forests to help stabilize carbon emissions.

After my contract ends in November, I'm really hoping to move to a different, specific city (because of family and roots I have there).  The city I want to move to is very urban and I don't see many field positions there at all, when I search online and talk to my peers.  

However, this city has a ton of environmental consulting firms, so I was hoping to use the experience I gain to with the government to get hired at a consulting firm.  

Will I be a desirable candidate with my field experience (plus multiple research projects, multiple field based internships, and good grades in undergrad) for hiring at a consulting firm?  Or do they look specifically for people with consulting experience?  


Would it be relatively easy to switch into consulting with my brief government contract, or would it be difficult without any direct consulting experience?

If it was a beach or something, the damage would be much greater, I know that there's plastic acetate in them and all.

While I have enjoyed this job I feel that I am hitting a ceiling with what I can do at my current company. I am not interested in going to the client side because I would most likely have to take a pay cut, and would travel just as much. I'm hoping anyone with similar skills or career can give advice on potential next steps I could take with the experience I have be it in this industry or in related/unrelated field. Thanks!

83,environmental_science,Having trouble finding an entry level job so I can start a career in Environmental Health and Safety,"I'm having a tough time starting my career in Environmental Health and Safety (EHS). I'm looking for some advice on how to get the ball rolling with a career in EHS.

About me:

I'm 26 years old and have a bachelors in Exercise Science and Nutrition with a 3.52 GPA.

I don't have a job and I live with my parents in the suburbs of Washington DC.

I'm starting to feel like a loser after not having a job for about 9 months now.

I don't want to go back to grad school, because I don't like school and I suck at it. I tried Physical Therapy school right after getting my bachelors, but I realized that PT wasn't for me and also I failed out lol. I worked as a sales dude at a gym after that for about a year and a half, and then I went to school to get a Masters in Public Health. I finished like about 20ish credits for the degree and then I dropped out and moved back in with my parents because grad school makes me depressed and anxious. I'm not normally a depressed or anxious person, but something about grad school makes me shut down. I much rather have a full-time job than go back to school.

The summer before I dropped out, I was working as a student intern at the university's department of Environmental Health and Safety for about 3 months. I worked with the radioactive waste management people. I worked with the industrial hygiene people doing air quality measurements, checking chemical fume hoods, and noise exposure. I briefly worked with the fire safety people. I like all that stuff. I like EHS, because I like going out and investigating things, I like talking to people, but I also like to just go back to my desk and sit there and do desk-job type of work. Not to mention, that I like the actual field. Now, I know that I want to get a career started in EHS.

So now, I've been back with my parents for about 9 months now and I've been looking for EHS jobs in the Washington DC metro area. I'm looking for entry levels jobs to get my foot in the door, but I haven't even been offered an interview. A lot of 'entry level' jobs require 1-3 years experience in EHS.

My parents are super supportive of me, but I'm definitely starting to feel like a piece of shit living at home without a job. I've only been looking at jobs in Washington DC and surrounding areas, because I never really contemplated moving out of the area (friends and family are all here basically). But now, I'm getting desperate and I'm starting to realize that I can just move to wherever offers me a promising EHS job. I just need something that can give me that 2-3 years experience and then I feel like I would be over that initial hump that is preventing me from getting my career rolling. I just need to get over that initial hump and get experience under my belt. I'm not totally against volunteering at places, because I'm starting to feel desperate and I'll do whatever it takes (as long as it's not more school).

I'm actually fine with taking like one class at a time and then I get certified in something after the course is over (maybe online, or somewhere local). Does anyone know any good certifications to get in general for EHS?

**I guess my main question here is: What can I do (relatively quickly...like in a span of 6 months or less) to make myself stand out when applying for entry level jobs?**

In a super old reddit thread, somebody mentioned ASSE (American Society of Safety Engineers) and said it was a good way to network. Does anyone know of any clubs or societies or whatever that you recommend I join? Does anyone know of any certifications (online would be nice) that you recommend I work towards?

Are there any cities or locations in the U.S that have a lot of entry level EHS jobs? I have friends in Jacksonville, FL but there doesn't seem to be many entry level EHS jobs there. I have friends in York, PA and I applied to the handful of entry level EHS jobs there as well. Colorado would be awesome to live at, and I have a friend in Colorado Springs. 

I posted this in the jobs subreddit as well. 

Thank you folks

This is great during the winter, but during the summer, the place would be an oven if we didn't run the A/C, but only if we have the curtains open. With them closed, things stay relatively cool, and the A/C has to run fairly infrequently.

This has gotten me to wondering which option is better. I know that A/C's have a much higher need for energy, but it doesn't run all the time. If the curtains are closed, the lights would need to be on pretty much all the time (I work from home, and can't do my job in the dark).

So, as the title asks, which is a better option, environmentally: Curtains closed, lights on, A/C running less frequently, or curtains open, lights off, A/C running more frequently?",1527781838

My boyfriend currently works as an Environmental Scientist for a reputable firm in Virginia (he has been working they’re for about 4 years now). Two years ago I took a job in New Jersey and we did the long distance thing while he looked for a position up there but again and again were told that they needed someone with NJDEP experience; we even hired a headhunter who said it was basically like he would have to start over because he wasn’t familiar with NJDEP regulations. Eventually we gave up and I took another job back in Virginia but am looking to move back to New Jersey in the next couple of years because that is where my family is and because there are a lot more opportunities there in my field (e-commerce and buying). 
My questions are:
-Is there a way like through a course or studying that he could become familiar with NJDEP regulations?
-Has anyone else in this field ever moved across states and encountered this kind of resistance?
-Any recommendations on how best to approach potential hiring companies? 

His firm has offices in MD, VA and NC and move people across those offices but I read that NJ has much stricter environmental regulations so I am thinking that is probably complicating this.",1527646232

I am a first-year student at a California university who is currently working towards an Environmental Science &amp; Management degree. My main interests in environmental science incllude ecology, restoration, plants&amp;animals, and the like. In the future, I would love to work out in the field a lot more than being in an office/lab. By this I mean going out to these places and collecting samples/data in an effort to restore habitats and such. The current degree I'm working on in ESM, like I said, with an ""Ecology, Biodiversity and Conservation Track"". The thing is, this program is very interdisciplinary with classes such as Economics, Geology, and Statistics (which I know are important and plan on taking regardless.), so I feel as this won't really lead me necessarily towards the path of my desired career. Now I recently found out there is also an ""Ecological Management and Restoration"" major offered, which sounds more down the alley I wanna follow. The courses for this are much more focused on ecology and plant biology and seems to be more field/practice oriented. I wanted to know any of your opinions on what degree sounds better or you think will lead me more towards what I'd like (and will give me better opportunities possibly). Thank you!! :)",1527355657

As you may have heard from various pseudoscience quackery types, there was a fellow by the name of Robert W. Wood who, in 1909 supposedly 'debunked' climate change science. I have seen numerous sites cite him when engaging in aforementioned quackery, and I am curious to hear the community's standing on his experiments. 

I, personally, am of the opinion that his experiments have absolutely 0 bearing on actual climate science, as there are a number of variables missing from his experiment, most notably, a steady increase in GHG presence in his ""closed system"" (a beaker with some covering over it lying out in the sun). In what other ways do you think this experiment falls short? Is it valid in your eyes?

I have always thought this would be my dream job, but now I'm feeling really iffy about the whole thing. 

Problems:

* Field work: For the most part awesome, but so many rules/safety concerns due to it being gov't work, that is has me terrified to screw up. Especially the truck \- Driving thru rutted roads = high chance of getting stuck = jokes/problems.
* The project is also half construction site, so I'm dealing with a bunch of guys who don't care about the environmental work. And most of my future job appears to be keeping them in\-line regarding sampling. I'm not a fan of managing people who aren't under my umbrella of work.
* While I find the scope of the project very cool, I feel like I'm going to be too much of a grunt and not enough of ""big picture"" plans and discussion. 
* So. Many. Bugs.

What I'm Looking For \(I think\):

* Working with like\-minded individuals, w/ fewer gov't red tape and regulations, and employees who are generally on the same page.
* A healthy mix of outdoors time, along with planning, designing, testing projects.
* I love lab work and hard\-data work. Field work sampling has been fun too. As well as wildlife monitoring. If I could still be involved with all 3, that would be ideal.
* Want to be involved big\-picture... Not just scurrying from site to site on a deadline for regulation permits.

I get the general sense that I should head towards an engineering\-focused path and less of a park ranger path, but I really am not well\-informed on these careers.

Sort of in a dilemma here. I’m graduating this spring and recently accepted an internship offer with a well-known environmental NGO, with the implied possibility to lateral to a paid position afterwards.

Unfortunately, after getting the gig my future boss, who was communicative before, has basically dropped off the face of the planet to the point where I’m not even sure if this is a done deal anymore. The listing on their website for my position has disappeared but that’s literally it.

I was originally really excited about this and signed a lease (short-term, fortunately) and all that, since the job is on the opposite side of the country, but now I’m not so sure because it doesn’t seem like they really care all that much. I’d be unpaid so I suppose they don’t really see me as anything besides a paper pusher lol. I’m not sure if prestigious is the right word to use, but the NGO is really well-known in the environmental world and I was hoping for something a little more tangible/professional…like an official offer letter :/

For what it’s worth, I had the chance to intern with an agency last summer and they were awesome about everything, got my paperwork done super quick, very friendly over the phone, responsive to emails, etc. and once I arrived in person they were just as great. I’d love to go back someday but wanted to try other sectors before committing.

I don’t want to jump to conclusions but am I crazy for relocating for a job offer that doesn’t pay for anything besides maybe a bus pass and where the people don’t really seem to care? Did they change their mind and just not want to tell me? What would you do?

1,environmental_science,Another question regarding degrees/education... from someone who's got two unrelated degrees and works in a different field.,"I posed a question recently that was a little more broad, but now I have some clearer idea of what my end goal may be. For reference: 26 y/o with a BA in International Relations and an MBA. I work as a DBA for a healthcare focused software company. 

I'm not very satisfied with my job because reasons (sitting in the same spot ALL DAY EVERYDAY. Literally the only movement I get is going to the bathroom, almost complete lack of interest in the work and being way underpaid but that's less of an issue). So, I'm looking to change. I'm an outdoorsy type, but I don't need to work outside all day. A balance between indoors and outdoors would be ideal, but I realize this is also probably unrealistic, not to mention the outdoors part (if applicable) aren't going to be in picturesque areas that I want to hike or climb in. Really I'm just looking to not sit in the same spot typing all day. 

So, I've always been interested in geography, maps, and the environment. I've thus been drawn to the idea of getting some kind of training or education in environmental sci, geography, and/or GIS. Why I didn't choose this to begin with is another story involving 'get a degree now, do it now, just pick something, you're going to school whether you like it or not'.

Okay, so to get to the point, I've already got student loans (22K) and I'm only hesitant to go back to school because of the additional loans I would have to take out. I think that with the degrees I have, SOME of the workload would be waived (gen ed stuff) but most would remain - still expensive. This has driven me to consider a certificate program like this one (https://clas.ucdenver.edu/ges/programs/certificates/gis-certificate). 

My question is about the actual worth of a certificate with my education and experience vs a full-fledged bachelors. Can anyone speak to the relative worth of these options, or if I'm just going down a path of stupid altogether? Please bear in mind that I realize that a career in this kind of field is neither glamorous nor fruitful in a monetary sense.

I was super excited but sadly that excitement quickly faded. I want to point out though that this may just be a matter of me trying to adjust to my first 'big-boy job.'

Overall I feel like I don't get to work through very much science in my position as we mostly deal with construction and Phase I's.

I get that these things are important, but honestly it just stresses me out and feels distracting to my actual work.

6,environmental_science,What type of track did you take when getting you undergrad envi sci degree?,"I'll be attending UT-Austin in the fall and got accepted as a bio major, but I think it would be relatively easy to switch over to environmental science. Envi sci interests me a bit more than bio because bio covers a lot of topics I find pretty boring. 

However, I am worried about how an envi sci degree stacks up to a bio degree. A lot of my friends and family tell me that bio is the way to go and that its broader coverage might open more doors. I feel the exact opposite; I think the job market is pretty saturated with bio degrees and I wanna do something a bit more specific. That being said, I feel like envi sci is what I want to do *right now* but it's not something I've dreamt about since I was 8. However, since you take all your core science courses in your first two years, I don't think it'd be a big problem if I change my mind down the line.

On to the question in the title. I'm not big on math. I can handle advanced math but it really bores me and it isn't one of my strengths at all. At UT, envi sci majors can declare a track after their second year, going into geology, geography, or biology. I'm thinking I want to pursue the geography track and avoid as many upper division math and loosely-related science classes as I can. I know bio isn't as math-intensive as other natural science degrees, but I've always been better at writing than math or physics or chem and want to avoid science courses that don't interest me. Do you think having more geography coursework as an upperclassman would harm job prospects? I know at UT, as an EVS senior you can pretty much choose to intern at a variety of Texas firms or gov agencies so thats really nice. I'm thinking the unique setup of two years of core sciences, then a geography focus, and then an internship will give me a lot to work with as far as post-graduacy or jobs go. 

What do y'all think? Anyone have experience with an envi sci degree and a focus on geographical science?

I'm currently trying to find ways outside of work to improve my chances of landing a better job in restoration or other biological or ecological field work, but its hard to decide what to choose while not wasting too time and (more importantly) money in the process.   

My current thoughts are pretty much, GIS certification, WFA or WFR cert, or going back to grad school.  

in case it helps... a little background:
I've been working in environmental education for the past few years, and I yearn to get out of the field and into something more in restoration.  I'd prefer to be out in the field but need to start finding jobs that don't leave me at or under the poverty line at the end of the year.. I'm coming up on 30 and its getting a little ridiculous, but I'm struggling to find a way up and out that isn't just a program director position (which sounds like complete and utter hell to me).  

 I'm a little too old for most of the Americorp and other similar programs as I started down another (mostly unrelated) career path before being almost accidentally sucked into this money void of a career path... but I do have a pretty good background in audio (recording, production ect.)  which i know can help with some ecological work.  

Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. Thanks!

I feel like I am doing everything that is recommended: I have had 5 internships, I personalize my cover letters, I applied to 2 jobs a day since December, and I had someone look at my resume. I have had a few phone interviews but ultimately I'm hitting a plateau. 

After some brief (obsessive) self reflecting I have considered that maybe I need to figure out EXACTLY what I'd like to do. For example I have kind of been marketing myself as a well rounded employee, because that accurately describes my background. I have held internships in the social sciences, conservation, fishery research, and soil research. I wonder if I am not hearing back from employers because I am not focusing on the area that I am looking to work in. I am most interested in holding a Environmental Scientist position, but I'm also open to many different areas of the field because I am no where near done learning and I have discovered interests in things I would have never guessed. This is just one thing I've thought about and I want to know how important this is. 

Additionally I am looking both in state and out of state but I would prefer to relocate, and I know that can further complicate the situation. 

In short: what else can I be doing? Or is it just a waiting game at this point?

This is problematic because I am genuinely really interested in pursuing this field in more depth. Everything else about the university seems extremely appealing to me.

I was also really interested in learning more about Neuroscience, but again West Chester University doesn't offer any courses in that area, which is unfortunate.

One item I've not touched base on, is the importance of LinkedIn and maintaining an extensive biography and online presence. Go out of your way to find recruiters that work specifically in the area of your interests - whether it be in EHS, Env. Engineering, Remediation, Consulting...etc....

All jobs I've gotten (since my first one post college due to an on campus even) I've gotten because a recruiter found me on LinkedIn.

LinkedIn really gives you the opportunity to describe yourself, upload a photo, and go into detail about your work. It is also very easy for recruiters to reach out to you via LinkedIn messenger.

Well Ive finally figured it out, I want to go for geology with a basis on environmental science but the school I go to does not offer geology. I'll be graduating shortly so I'm thinking about my next plan of action.

Id like to stick with an environmental science background but I want to work in geology. Would it be smart for me to just finish this ES degree and move on to a master's in geology or should I get a double bachelors after this one and then move on to my master's? 

I'm asking because I'm just thinking of the best course of action to get me where I need to be, school wise and experience wise.

I am retaking a class in my senior year of undergrad. Last semester I failed Applied Interdisciplinary Data Analysis. The class revolves around one big independent data analysis project, which can study qualitative or quantitative data. I studied qualitative data to answer the question 'what do the national Vietnamese newspapers report about the trade of rhinoceros horn?' I performed a satisfactory analysis but I almost failed my midterm and final exams and submitted portions of my analysis late.

This semester I want to tackle this data analysis project earlier and smarter. And I want to analyze quantitative data. Can anyone make suggestions? I need to start with a topic, which would provide me with a certain data set, like a collection of soil samples.

So what good data is out there that I can analyze? For my sake, it should be data from the USA that would be easily accessible.

Maybe study the spread of an invasive species or the extinction of another (what data would I need to look at? What comparisons can I make? Maybe compare their range with one of their limiting factors or threats.)

Maybe study the effect of a natural/human disaster on biodiversity, like the aftermath of a forest fire. I could compare the changes in biodiversity over 5 years where a fire is t=2.5 and compare to forests where there hasn't been a fire in the last 5 years.

     - Water Infrastructure for Human Settlements
     - More info at swm.tufts.edu

Here are a few areas I would like to learn about:

Questions for undergraduates or early/mid-career professionals:

- How do you find out about or discover new educational opportunities?
- Do you see a masters degree in the water management field as a key part of your professional development?
- What are your main priorities when considering graduate school and what specific learning to you hope to gain from a masters degree?

Questions for mid/late-career professionals and employers:

- Do you consider a specialized masters degree in water management an essential or beneficial part of the professional development of your employees/work force?
- What water management skills do you see as absolutely essential for early/mid-career water professionals to obtain, either through academia or through work experience?

Thanks for your help - I really appreciate your time and would love to incorporate your ideas/advice when reaching out to applicants or improving our program. Thanks!

Like something that would utilize the gases omitted by the livestock there to power the farm, mainly automatic feeders, lights, a climate stabilizer.... like is there something like that that exists? And if it requires energy to run a machine to process the gases, maybe a windmill, geothermal energy source or solar panel to power said machine? Like.... I feel like if you had this setup to be big enough, that eventually the power produced by the processed gases being fed back into the farm would only require the renewable energy to exist as backup. I also thought that if you make the farm big enough you could do some truly revolutionary stuff, for example having a multi-layer farm where the very top serves as a greenhouse to grow not only food for humans, but feed for the animals on the farm, the layers between it and the bottom housing the smaller animals and then the biggest livestock like cows would be on the bottom. 

Now, again, this is simply just a hypothetical I came up with after about 7hrs of sleep and decided I'd post a question about it. I'm truly curious how viable this idea IS. Because if it's actually possible with some fancy engineering, then it'd solve the issue of greenhouse gases by raising too much livestock for people to ingest.",1514474489

76,environmental_science,Help for securing Environmental Summer Internship,"First post here so any and all help would be greatly appreciated. Currently a sophomore enrolled in Environmental Engineering at a top public school in the country. I am aware that an engineering degree is very valuable to securing a job after graduation in this industry but I am very determined to get a summer internship to help boost my resume and start making those connections. I've applied to a couple consulting and EHS ones online with no responses and need some advice on how to get my foot in the door with the smaller local consulting companies. Do I walk in with a suit and resume in hand and ask to speak to the PM? Do I send out countless emails with my schedule and availability and ask if I can be brought aboard? I know networking with professors is huge and I'm doing research with one next semester which should help, but my school is out of state and I would really prefer to intern in my state (MA). For anyone wondering I'm currently looking at soil and groundwater remediation for a career but also want to look at government and EHS to see what I would like best.

Geology w/ focus in lib arts: environmental science

Biology w/ focus in ecology &amp; env bio


They don’t have a env sci degree and was wondering which will be the best/closest to env sci. Also these are all BA’s. Should I skip and go to a different school( w/ higher tuition) (U of M Duluth) to get a BS in env sci?

99,environmental_science,Grad school admissions gpa requirements,"Hello!  

I was a double major in college and ended up with a gpa of 2.8 (combined for biology and technical theatre) I went to grad school once already in what i’ll call my less academic field of study (tech theatre, specifically sound design) and blew it out of the water with a 4.0 for my MFA program.  Just before graduating, however, i got an awesome job as a naturalist at the local state park and my career path drastically changed from the theatre life I thought I was headed towards to a life relying much more on my biology degree. 

Its been 3 1/2 years now and I’ve gotten some great experience as a naturalist and science educator but don’t want to be stuck on the bottom of the ladder making absolute shit money for the rest of forever. Becoming a program/camp director or getting my teachers license and becoming a k-12 teacher don’t really appeal to me and I would love to pursue a graduate degree in a biology related field (maybe sustainability, ecology, evolution...). Many programs seem to require a 3.0 or higher bachelors gpa for admission though.. which I do not have. How does a person reconcile this?  Can you retake lower-scoring classes to show you’ve since mastered the information?  Will my 4.0 in my masters program be considered in the admissions process?

It's roughly small (around 50 employees) firm which deals with phase assessments. The position is a junior environmental scientist position and will be in the site investigation and remediation team (phase assessments). 

So I already have had my first interview which was with the team manager and he asked me questions about my resume from top to bottom and basic technical (tell me about phase assessments, etc) and behavioral (why the interest in environmental consulting, etc) questions. He did not ask the typical interview questions one would expect (where do you see yourself in five years, tell me about yourself, etc). 

So now I have a second interview with him and his colleague tommorow. I'm a bit clueless as to what to do to prepare but I want to be well prepared as I was for my last interview. Any tips on what I should expect or types of questions I should prepare for would be greatly appreciated.

A little background - I began college in civil engineering but struggled in the department due to lack of interest and some personal things. I worked two internships - one for a surveying/land development company and the other a structural steel business - and got some good work experience, but definitely couldn't see myself doing either for a living. 

After a summer surveying and seeing farmlands and forests converted to Verizon stores, I decided to switch into Environmental Science with a focus in Restoration Ecology. My coursework has included ecology classes, some soil science and geology, GIS, and forestry classes. 

One job offer is a temporary but full-time position at a company that does mostly ecological work - endangered species surveys, wetland work and some stream restoration. I feel this company is a great and rare opportunity to get into the type of work I'd like to do for my career, but I feel it will be lower pay and there's no guarantee it would lead to a permanent position. 

The other offer is for a permanent consultant position with a small, full service consultant. The company has other locations, but I'd be working with just one other person in my location. 

I have technical skills from engineering and my internships, but I know very little about wetland delineation, stream restoration, etc... but would like to prepare myself as much as I can before beginning work. 

Any recommendations for someone who needs to learn deliniation fast? What questions should I ask before accepting an offer? Any gear recommendations for someone who will be spending a lot of time in the field?

So for some background on myself, I have an undergraduate degree in microbiology and a Master's degree in environmental science. I've been working in microbiology research (in a subfield tangentially related to environmental concerns) for a few years, and I recently completed an internship with an environmental science &amp; engineering company as part of my MS, but I'm looking to put my newly acquired MS to use as a career.

I've done the 9 to 5 life, and like an increasing number of people I found it wholly depressing. 'Crushing' would be closer to the truth. It's not an issue of not enjoying the work, but the monotony of it and the fact that 5 days on and 2 days off doesn't seem like much of a balance is just draining. Are there any environment-related careers I could look into that have, for example, longer shifts spread across fewer days? From experience this type of schedule works much better for my sanity!

You are to assume the role of a consultant tasked with designing a stream restoration project for a private client. You have a budget of $2,000,000 to perform all design efforts related to the task. In that budget, your deliverable is to develop a detailed budget - line item by line item - which addresses all components of performing a design in an urban area.
Please note that area residents are complaining about flooding in a stream next to the property that your client owns.

82,environmental_science,Is it possible to get into a more environmental science type field with an environmental studies degree?,"I'm currently studying at the University of California. This particular campus doesn't offer environmental science and I just transferred here to finish my degree. I'm studying environmental studies. The program here requires pre-cal, bio, econ, and a little chemistry for lower div. We also take an ocean science class that teaches us to use the programming language R. I've also taken an intro stats course. In upper div, I'll be taking a lot of ecology classes, maybe have some chances for GIS, geology, anthropology etc to fulfill my requirements. There will also be a lot of field work, natural history, etc. 

It's unclear to me just what will be available to me as a graduate. I know of some things, but I'd like to be involved in something more research oriented and maybe work in a lab setting. I'm volunteering in a marine lab right now as a research assistant. 

I usually hear my advisors say that this is a social science field. To me, it does involve a lot of STEM, so I'm hoping there will at least be some STEM based careers I might have access to after graduation. 

There's a program at my school that allows you to be connected to graduates in your field. There was only one ENVS graduate in the database and she hasn't gotten back to me. 

My advisor for my major says to talk to my professors about careers, but honestly, they don't seem super oriented towards what exactly I'd be able to do after graduation outside of what they have chosen to do.

85,environmental_science,Career path question for environmental consultants,"Hello,

I’ve been working in environmental consulting for three years as a GIS technician for a large firm. Within the first three months of being hired I got my 40-hr Hazwoper cert and was sent off for field work as a field team leader on 2 large soil sampling projects.

The field work has been pretty intense over the past 3 years and, as a result, I have done a much smaller amount of GIS work compared to field (probably around 70% field / 30% GIS). My last stint of being out in the field lasted for about a year and a half and I gained a lot of experience, enjoyed being around the technicians, and saved up a good chunk of money for myself. 

My experience gained in GIS has been pretty minimal. However, I feel like I am good at the basic tasks I am regularly assigned. I am just not getting enough exposure with the constant fieldwork to become experienced in coding in GIS and I feel like this is going to affect how far I can progress in that career path. My interest in doing monotonous computer work has dwindled as well since I have experienced how awesome being outside all day is. I feel like I would just be “drifting” if I devoted my time to being a GIS technician. 

Is it reasonable to try to focus my career path into constantly being in the field for a few years and establishing myself as an environmental scientist? Has anyone in environmental consulting had an experience similar to mine?

90,environmental_science,Chlorpyrifos - how does prenatal exposure occur?,"I'm a senior in college writing a big paper on chlorpyrifos (a pesticide, controversial because the Obama administration was going to ban most of its uses, and Trump admin. has reversed that. 

I have to recommend whether or not to ban it. Based on the reading i've done so far (~20 sources), it appears that chlorpyrifos doesn't pose a massive risk to the non-human organisms unless they are very close to the source (farm field where it is applied).

For humans, it appears that chlorpyrifos is low enough in concentrations that the average person far from an application site is not at risk.  However, applicators of the pesticide can be at risk, so part of my recommendation will be application should be strictly regulated to minimize contamination risk

When it comes to prenatal exposure, everyone points to multiple studies from Rauh including [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26385760) which show that prenatal exposure can cause damage.  I'm wondering, how does prenatal exposure occur?  I can't find any information on that.  The children in this study would have been conceived well after the 2001 ban of chlorpyrifos in residential areas, so how did they get exposed in New York City where there are no farm fields?

I'd always thought my ES degree wasn't enough science for me and it seemed every environmental job opening required an engineer so I thought why not?

I just started my second year of engineering school and realized it is NOT for me. Misery of the course load aside I'm just not interested in the subject matter.

I still have 2+ years left on my GI Bill so I really want to drop engineering and get a master's degree instead. I would like to stay in the water resources field but I want to pick a program that will give me the best chance of finding a job. The grad degrees I'm considering are:

Water Resources Science

Environmental Science (water resources focus)

Geology (hydrology/hydrogeology focus)

I'm still exploring career options but I'd honestly be happy doing anything with water. Maybe a bit heavier on the science component. I know employers want a specialist but I'm worried about going too niche and having to move across the country to where the jobs are.

My question is what are the main differences between these degrees and what kinds of careers can they lead to? Any thoughts about the job outlook?

70,environmental_science,EnvioScience major in their very first semester who probably should’ve pursued Enginerring. Need advice.,"Im in my first year of college and I’m pursuing a BS in EnvioScience rn by doing a 2+2 program where I get an associates when I finish community college then transfer to a 4 year college, and thanks to this sub I’m also gonna be pursuing GIS too after this semester. I organized this so poorly since I didn’t know what I wanted to do until near the end of senior year, but I think I’d like to be involved in Policy and/or sustainable development too as I have a dream of one day becoming a politician and using that power to push us towards 100% clean and renewable energy and fixing our ecosystem while also rebuilding our infrastructure (I know, pipe dream). 

The community college I’m at rn doesn’t have political science, but I’m transferring my credits in 2 years to a 4 year college (Hopefully Penn State since they’re the 2nd best college in my state for my major) so I could take political science there; but I’m a little ignorant about how minors and certificates work so I don’t know if that’s even viable. I’m also wondering if I should be taking an engineering class since I have a few years of CAD experience from high school and I’m seeing a lot of people saying that Enviornmental Science winds you up with low paying jobs, which kinda makes me regret not majoring EnvioEnginering instead.

 Would taking political science for 2 years even get me anything? 

Is it possible for me to even pursue policy and/or sustainable development while I’m doing  EVIOS and GIS? 

Could I use an EnvioScience and an Engineering degree as a substitute for EvioEngineering? 

Can I and should I try to get into Environmental Policy, Environmental Law, or Environmental Engineering instead?

I’m so fucking disorganized and indecisive I need help. I can’t even concentrate on my homework right now cause im thinking about it nonstop, I’m worried.

TLDR: I’m a freshmen in my first semester taking EnvioScience who just realized that they chose a major that will leave them living the rest of their life broke, need advice badly.

Environmental Science
Macroeconomics 
Math
English

1. Graduate at the end of the semester with a single degree. In doing so I will be forfeiting my other degree and will not be able to go for it again with starting all over again. However, I will have a degree by the end of the year, or;

2. Wait until this time next year to start the unit again.

I would have no degree until the end of 2018, but I would have two afterwards.

I am thinking long term and know that I want to work with the government doing forest management/planning in the western U.S.. If any of you are wondering why I wanted to go abroad for my degree, its because its always been a dream of mine to live in another country and learn a new language so I figured I would kill two birds with one stone with this program. 

Anyways, to my overall point, I want to make this dream of working for the government a reality after I graduate. I have three potential ideas for making this a reality once I am done with school and I want to know the pros and cons of each.

My first idea is to get a PhD at a school out west after I get my masters. I know that a PhD is a great way to make connections and get access to higher level positions in the public sector. The cons of this that I know of are that it will take around 5 years to complete this and it is a daunting task. 

My second idea is to join the peace corps after I graduate hopefully in a position that utilizes sustainable forestry management. This would be shorter than a PhD and would also give me the NCE that peace corp volunteers receive. I also like the idea of living abroad longer but am worried about no income for 4 years.

My last idea would be just to apply to internships/seasonal positions with the government and try to get my foot in the door that way. I know of one program that I would eligible for a 5-month paid internship and I would hope that with my research experience/MsC that I would be in good shape to find a permanent position.

These are my thoughts. Sorry for the wall of text. I wanted to get some input from people who have potentially gone through what I am right now. I know that my priority in grad school should be to have a good gpa and get as much research experience as I can.",1504726752

I've got a BS and MS in computer science, and I work for a Major Tech Company, but I've discovered that working on meaningless products and lining the pockets of a possible monopoly is kind of soul-sucking.  Perhaps I should have gone to school for ES in the first place, but I followed the money and here I am.

Given that I already have a technical degree, I'm hoping to find a way to transition careers without going back to school.  What I'm wondering, I guess, is if having a technical but unrelated degree helps me at all here.  Are you guys aware of any jobs or job families that are more open to someone in my position?  I'm specifically hoping for something that would have career prospects in research and conservation. 

Currently I've just been looking into volunteer opportunities to get myself out there and start talking to people in the field.  I live in Seattle, so there are lots, thank goodness.  My thought is that, perhaps, I'd be able to build up some relevant experience through volunteering and then present myself as a viable candidate.

(I am also looking into going back to school, and in fact I kind of really want to because I love school.  I just don't want to spend tens of thousands on another degree if I don't really need to.)

For what it's worth, I'm also looking into the more obvious option of finding a programming job working for an environmental organization, since computers are everywhere, and I'd definitely feel better working on something that helped the environment than I currently do working on meaningless buzzword nonsense products.  This will probably be my next career move no matter what.  I just want to avoid getting pigeonholed into tech forever.",1504543021

I have a BA in geography and I plan on going back to college this September for the Environmental Technician program at one of the colleges in southern Ontario.

I went to university without a real career path planned and it wasn't until my 3rd year that I decided I wanted to get into the environmental field post university. I placed myself in a bad position given that I was in an arts program and not enviro sci/ eng. 

That's why I am attending one of the colleges here in Ontario to get a diploma in enviro tech. I know enviro techs don't make a ton of money but I do have a few other questions.

I'd like to know more about the possibility for career advancement in Canada from the position of enviro tech. Ideally I'd like to eventually get a position with a CA or the MNR. However I don't want to stay in the pay grade of a tech for my entire career.

Anyone mind indulging my questions here?","So, I'm returning to school at the age of 24, and basically needing to start from the beginning to get this degree (which is like a robust ES degree that my college is pretty well respected for). 

Initially not knowing what I will do with it, I thought at least that there are a large amount of GIS analyst jobs around me, and generally things like the forestry or fishery or other similar things usually tend have odd positions waiting to be filled.

Now that I'm here I'm being offered a way to get my Masters in 5 years, and how it works is I will basically take the normal classes the first 3 years, in year 4 I will be put right into Masters level courses with grad students, and in year 5 I will do some kind of real world impact project as my Masters project.   

I still pay about the same tuition for year 5 as I do for the undergrad years. But save time and money by getting it done quickly.

I guess I just want to ask, do you think this is alright from the perspective of gaining employment later on. For example, will an organization look at it funny to have a Masters Degree with no work experience aside from an internship here or there? (which I do plan to do)

The upside of this route is that I will get to do my own basically passion project with a real world impact, which I think is really cool, and my university gives you a lot of assistance and resources to help you accomplish this (students have done sustainability projects all over the world, India, Kenya, Mexico, and at home, etc etc).  

Once I move on from this 5 year route though, and paying this money back will become the big issue, do you think this might set me up in a good place to have just gone straight for the Masters?

Is it too late for me to make any real headway in environmental work, as I am already 30 with no experience under my belt? Is the bio masters the better option?",1502284149

While on Facebook earlier today I came across an article covering a couple different ocean clean up efforts such as 4 Ocean and the Surf Rider Foundation. While reading about these awesome and cool these organizations are, I started to think about waste disposal and how bad we are at it. And as I continued to ponder these things I started to wonder whether or not organizations such as these (which are doing great work that needs to be done) are sucking up funding and man power that could be better placed else where. IMO, I think that to really tackle the issue of waste build up in our oceans, we need to attack the source. We need to prevent the plastic and waste from even getting in the ocean in the first place. It is as if we are trying to fix an compound fracture with a band-aid. Are my thoughts completely misplaced or misguided? I just thought i'd ask people who could actually tell me something tangible.

About to graduate with a ~3.40-3.50 GPA and multiple undergraduate research projects under my belt, including a symposium presentation.  Field internship completed and I am hoping to do a consulting or state govt. internship in the spring before graduating.  

I've been really interested in environmental consulting, and my main goal after graduation is to move to NYC to join most of my family who has moved there the past few years.  My eventual goal is to go to graduate school in an environmental/ecology program but I want to work for a bit to narrow my interests and take some time away from school.  Not too worried about grad school right now (although I am going to take the GRE just to have it out of the way)

1) How many consulting firms are there in big cities like New York? 

2)Are they harder to get hired at then a firm in a smaller city or town?  

3) Do I have a good shot at getting hired at as an entry level consulting firm in a city like New York? (Assuming I can do an environmental consulting internship for 3-6 months before graduating)

99,environmental_science,Would a Master's Be Good Enough for Environmental Science or Related Career?,"Hello all!

My ultimate goal is to be a professor in relation to my field of study, which is Religious Studies with an emphasis on Native American and Indigenous religious traditions. I have a B.A. and an M.A. in this field, and I did my research on Indigenous religions and the environment (yes, it's very relevant) and is a huge passion of mine. I've been told that this specialty has a lot more positions open in academia than for your average Religious Studies major, and I do very much want to go back and get a Ph.D so I can have a much bigger chance of becoming a prof and teaching and doing research (as an aside, I'm also going to apply for other programs besides Religious Studies to give me a bigger chance of getting accepted). 

However, right now I'm a substitute teacher, and I technically live below the federal poverty line. I'm sick of living paycheck to paycheck, or on meager student loans, as I have for around the last 10 years. I never can retain savings IF I even have any, my credit cards are maxed out, I'm in a payday loan hole, and my debt is pretty high, as you can imagine. I can't even pay any of my student loans because my income is too low. So, I've wondered about a backup career just in case, or maybe at least another career for a few years so I can at least save up a tiny bit of money and not worry about food stamps, food banks, donating plasma, collection agencies, etc. I'd also love to travel, or at least be able to visit my friends across the state once in a while without breaking my bank. Or even be able to do day trips sometimes, really. I've thought about getting a teaching credential, but I don't think I really want to teach non-university students, having done so for about two years now. As a sub, students are pretty disrespectful, as you can imagine, and it's left me a bit burned out in terms of teaching minors. I've always loved learning about the environment, however, and I consider myself an amateur naturalist.

So, I've thought, maybe I could pursue a career in EnviroSci or something similar like forestry. It at least is relevant to my previous training and interest in religion and the environment. I really want my research to apply to current environmental science and ecology and such with Indigenous communities and habitat restorations. Also, if I were to become a prof in such a field, an EnviroSci degree would probably be a bonus. Plus I'd have a fallback just in case I couldn't find a job as a prof very easily. BUT, you can see the dilemma here.

I don't have degrees in hard science, and hard science positions usually want that if you want any sort of money. I could perhaps get another Master's in environmental science or forestry or ecology or what have you, but I'm not sure how many would accept it with my humanities background and lack of credits in math and science. If they did, I might have to take extra classes (and I detest math, and have never been good at it), and plus extra debt. So, I'm not sure if it's worth it, even though it's something I'd be interested in and would help me to avoid living in poverty for another decade or so as I get a Ph.D and try to find a job. 

What do you recommend? Would I be able to get into Master's programs with my background? Would I be able to get a job without a B.A. in a hard science, even? Would it be worth it? Or should I just skip on my merry way towards getting my Ph.D in Religious Studies or American Studies or what have you and hope for the best?     ",1501716174
0,environmental_science,Great white shark populations are rising along both the east and west U.S. coasts. Might this increase translate into more great white attacks?,"If one listens to the message from shark conservationists, perhaps the answer is No.  In their opposition to shark culling, i.e., reducing shark numbers for public safety, they repeatedly tell us that shark numbers have little to do with the rate of attack.  An increase in attacks, they tell us, is primarily (exclusively?) driven by an increased number of ocean users.

A statement from professor Laurie Laurenson, Deakin U, Australia"":  “I can show statistically that there is no relationship between the number of sharks out there and the number of shark attacks.""   Laurenson's statement is emphatic, but be assured that many other shark conservationists offer a similar sentiment.  

*(Perhaps Laurenson's statement is not in context and was intended not as a generality but pertaining to a specific site [though the article does not suggest that]. Note the response from a representative from the Natal Sharks Board.  The NSB has been culling sharks along east Africa for 40-plus years.)*

https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/the-herald-south-africa/20160209/281560879837183

I'll allow the defenders of this perspective to explain why there is minimal correlation between the size of an animal population (sharks) and its sum impact upon the environment (in this case, the number of attacks).

But I'll offer one opinion:  If it works in one direction, it works in the other: If we will grant that rising great white populations along both coasts will inevitably translate into more attacks, then a marked reduction of the shark population in an area with a high level of attacks, e.g., Reunion Island off east Africa, will translate into fewer attacks.  *(since 2011, 23 attacks, 9 dead).*

4,environmental_science,environmental science vs. engineering degree?,"I'm majoring in environmental science currently but am seriously worried about getting a job after college, both in terms of money and job satisfaction. I currently have a botany internship and let me tell you... I now know that I do NOT want to work with plants. The zoology and chemistry aspects of my major interest me, but I hear so many stories about people regretting their ES degrees due to lack of jobs. I've been considering getting an engineering degree. However, I would practically have to start over in school (I'm a sophomore and picked my major second semester), and math is my most difficult subject. I think if I spent a lot of time on it, I could manage the math classes but I'm honestly not sure. I'd have to work my way up from precalc I to calculus III at my CC to get my associate (and then transfer for my bachelor's). It's obviously a huge jump in terms of difficulty from environmental to engineering.
Basically, ES degree = 3 more semesters, lower paying job and less job options. Engineering degree = at least 4 more semesters, much more difficult, but more job opportunities and better paying. 

If anyone has any insight or advice, I would love to hear it. Is an ES bachelor's degree really worth anything? Should I just try to whip myself into shape in terms of math ability and go for the engineering degree?

Analytical Sciences Option
The Analytical Sciences Option is designed to produce chemists who are particularly interested in the chemical pollutants that are being released into the air, earth and water environments of our planet. They may find jobs with local and state health departments, state and national environmental protection agencies, local testing laboratories, as well as in the private chemical-producing industries. Typically graduates work as laboratory and field technicians who sample and analyze chemical pollutants.


The Earth Sciences Option is designed to prepare students for a career in environmental geology. Today many environmental problems are associated with the earth and our use of it. Thus, contamination of surface and underground waters,pollution of the soil and construction of dams and other large structures all require earth science environmental specialists to either help alleviate the problem created by misuse, or avoid environmental problems during project development. Many public and private agencies, including engineering and construction firms, have jobs for people trained in this area. 


﻿Geography and Planning Option
The Geography and Planning Option is primarily designed to produce local and regional planning specialists who have a good understanding of environmental problems. Anytime humans change the nature of the landscape by constructing new housing developments, highways, shopping centers, etc. a potentially negative environmental impact to the natural landscape exists. Today planners who are environmentally sensitive are in great demand to help avoid the common confrontations that arise between developers and those groups that are affected by the project.


﻿Life Science Option 
The Life Science Option is designed to prepare a student for jobs in environmental biology which have something to do with the impact of modern technology and change on life forms. These include working as pollution monitoring technicians for various public agencies such as county and state health departments, as well as state and national environmental protection agencies; students may also find themselves attracted to jobs with local, regional and national nature conservation agencies, both public and private. These jobs may involve monitoring endangered species, evaluating habitat, making inventories of wildlife, or interpreting nature as a ranger in a public or private environmental education center.",1500680695

It goes like this, imagine a grid, on each point would be a pillar. each of these pillars would be put into the ground at what I would say at a minimum of 100ft deep. The tops of the pillar would be on the surface of the ground. These pillars would then do 1 of 2 things (this is where I start to think about what would work better or at all). The first would be to absorb the grounds heat around it and expel it at the top. or the 2nd would be the opposite and they would instead cool the ground surrounding them. The concept is to cool enough of the surface area of the ground to keep the build up of heat lower. I believe this could lower temperatures if only by 3-5 degrees depending on the areas placed. (Major cities would be the easiest but eventually having them over large land masses would be perfect world)

Sorry in advance if this is similar to many other posts in this sub (I've read a ton of them already, but figured there's no harm asking for myself)

I just finished my first year at university in environmental science. Although I sometimes worry about finding a job in this field (then again, who doesn't), I really do love what I'm studying and can't imagine myself doing anything else. My problem lies in choosing a specific major (which I have to do before September). 

The faculty of environment at my school has a ton different majors, but I've narrowed my interests down to....
- Atmospheric Environment &amp; Air Quality 
- Earth Science &amp; Economics
- Ecological Determinants of Health
- Water environments &amp; ecosystems  

 ... which is still a lot to choose from! I'd be equally happy working in any of these sectors, so I'll probably pick based on job security/availability. If you work in any of these fields, please tell me your experiences- what you like/dislike, your education, the expectations vs realities, etc. I've done as much research (aka googling) as I can but I'd love to hear your personal thoughts :)   ",1500162194
49,environmental_science,Help me to choose graduate program. Major concern is Energy,"I need some suggestions. Folks, please help me.

I am a petroleum engineering graduate. As Job security is volatile in oil gas industry, so what other options available to switch another major? What are the fields available to switch with this specified background? I am planning on pursuing Masters on energy or related concern. I really love the concept of energy. Really passionate about to stay in the energy related field. Now, will you please help me to pick one from the following?

I have few things in my mind. Please share your opinion, experiences with the following points.

1) Energy Related programmes, like Energy Engineering, Energy Technology Where the efficiency and optimization would be major concern (correct me if I am wrong). Can you please tell me anything about the job scenario of energy engineer or energy technologist? What are their major role in industry? Efficiency only?

2) Energy management, Energy Economics. . It's like MBA or MA. However as long as the things are energy related so it would be okay. But this programmes require job experience which I don't have right now.

3) Sustainable Energy. It's completely renewable sector. So would I be able to cope with it with my specified petroleum engineering background?

4) As petroleum engineering is most of about computational technology, so I have extensive knowledge on computational programming languages. I am a problem solver with huge volume of Data. Digitalization is the future of oil &amp; gas and Data Science is the pioneer of this digitalization. So what about pursuing Data Science as graduate study? Data science knowledge would be useful for any kind industry. So I wouldn't have to worry about the ups &amp; downs of industries.

Moreover, please tell me the name of middle-rank universities of US and Canada, who offer masters degree on the above mentioned programmes.

Then, what are the chances of a petroleum graduate will achieve a graduate funding in the energy related masters study? Have you know anyone who had petroleum major in undergraduate but switched to another major related to energy or other concern with full funding? Have anyone switched to renewable graduate study having petroleum background? I would like to get the research assistant type position so that I wouldn't have to worry about financial issues. I am comfortable with research works.

Please share your experience. Moreover, if you can guide me to any other sources where i will find the answer of my all or some queries above i mentioned, i will be really grateful to you.

Thanks for reading the long text.

I'm a transfer student to Arizona State University and I was curious to see what experience any members have had at ASU, particularly in majors having to do with rangeland and wildlife management! I'm starting my major in Natural Resource Ecology at the Polytechnic campus in the fall and I'm curious as to what opportunities there are out there at this school for this field? I have written to a couple of professors with no reply yet (I do understand it is summer) and have spoken with an advisor, who did help me out a ton. The degree has a general track which focuses on both Wildlife and Rangeland Management or tracks focusing in each one. I'm leaning toward Rangeland at the moment and would love to hear anyone's opinions and experiences or anything they have heard from the faculty and research here. I want to pursue grad school after finishing my undergrad but I want to get really good field experience as well. Also, if you have graduated, what are your experiences working in the field? Any information will be appreciated! Thank you!",1499958104
55,environmental_science,MS or PhD?,"Hello! I just completed a BS in general biology, and I am currently enrolled in a MS program (Environmental Biology). I am, however, starting to actually think about job options and lifestyles and debating whether or not to do a PhD instead. Anyone in the environmental fields of biology with a MS or PhD, I would love to know what you think about the job options for either level of education. I also want to know about lifestyles surrounding these jobs. 

Additionally, the MS I am enrolled in is fairly general. Is it better to be in a specific or general program? With a general MS, does this bode well for work in loosely related fields (say renewable energy for example)?

Does one degree offer more or less flexibility? Better or worse life/work balance? More diversity in job activities?

I have done a lot of work with city government (weed and wildlife control) as well as with consulting firms (rare plant surveys on potential oil fields) and I have not found either to be particularly fulfilling for myself. These are both important jobs, but I want to know what other kinds of options are out there, and what educational background is needed. 

Research is very appealing, but will such a field require me to be away from home constantly? Is it hard to find jobs? Do you have to live near or work for a university?

Also, I think it is incredibly hard uncover all of the job possibilities within this or related fields. Anyone within this field, what is your job? What are the responsibilities? The best and worst parts? Are you fulfilled? What education/experience led you to these jobs?

Thank you so much for any feedback you can give me!",1499916370

Yet when I visit energy.gov's page that details each state on their renewable power, it claims that Idaho is ""100%"" renewable.

So far I have: platbooks (for detailed specimen locations/data over very small regions), maps with plotted areas intending to gather comparative data (e.g. Points along a river every twenty miles), a TDS meter for water hardness, microscopes, glass vials and droppers for water collection, and various plant specimen containers.

89,environmental_science,What knowledge should we use to determine if the practice of culling sharks reduces the incidence of attack? Marine biology? Statistics? How about experience and common sense?,"Shark conservationists have posed a persistent challenge to culling. Attached is a recent example pertaining to the island of Reunion (east of Madagascar), which has suffered a spate of shark attacks. The author, George Burgess, also heads the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), widely regarded as expert authority on sharks and attacks.

https://theconversation.com/culling-sharks-wont-protect-surfers-73801

There are a host of problems related to shark culling, including environmental damage, lack of knowledge of the exact shark population size (primary species posing a danger: great white, tiger and bull) and the difficulty of determining how many sharks have to be killed to increase public safety But these factors do not negate the efficacy of the process.

In simple terms, culling seeks to reduce the sum impacts of the individuals of an animal population. There are but three outcomes:

The animal population is reduced insufficiently to have any effect.

The population reduction produces results ranging from minor to heavy.

The population reduction results in extinction. Example: population of grizzly bears that used to inhabit California.

If the culling does not result in the desired outcome, it simply means--pardon the bluntness--that the level of killing must be escalated, repeatedly if necessary. Common sense can rarely be acknowledged to be an answer for anything, but this situation seems to be an exception.

Additional questions: For years the ISAF has pushed two themes:

 1) Shark attack is extremely rare; you’ll sooner be hit by lightning. 

2) Humans pose a far greater threat to sharks; we kill some 63-100 million sharks a year.

Are not these two correlated? Should we not accept that this rather dramatic number of shark deaths brings us this low level of attack?

I am open to relocation but none of their facilities are in my top 5 states.

I am eager to get into a field more closely related to my degree. I don't see a lot of potential for growth until much later 3-5 years(?). Potential for lateral movement may be a possibility. I would become more knowledgeable on DOT regulations and working with potentially hazardous waste.

I graduated with a B.S. in Environmental Science and I am now applying to jobs. I am starting to realize that every environmental science related job out there is dependent on GIS. This wasn't really why I chose this field. I was looking for something along the lines of field work, not necessarily on a desk working on GIS. I would have majored in Comp Sci if this is what I wanted. 

Any ways I recently applied to a Conservation assistant position that deals with water management laws and permits (something I did my capstone on). I applied to this jobs because it did not mention the need to know how to work with GIS. Everything was going great until the manager asked if I know how to operate GIS. I told him that I took the course before but I am not good at it and the whole interview went downhill from there. I took intro to GIS... I got an 'A' in it, but it was absolutely hell. It was the worse class that I took in my whole college and highschool career or just say it was the worse course I had taken in my LIFE. There were days where I spent 12 hours straight on trying to fix something. i can't see myself being productive in an office that is dependent on the use of GIS.

Is another field I could approach that is not dependent on GIS or should I just take my Summa cum laude Environmental Science degree and wipe my ass with it. Mind you... the advisors have us take GIS in the second sem junior year or first sem of senior year. So by then it is way too late to change paths. i just stuck it out.

54,environmental_science,Why do you (did you) want to be an Environmental Scientists? Or why did you want to go into the Environmental field or Conservation?,"Hey guys! I know this might sound like a weird question but, I am new to this field and needed some words of encouragement. I just recently changed my major to Biology in focus of Ecology and Evolution from Biological Sciences. I am in this Bridges Program over the summer but it is for Biomedical Research. I have been discouraged lately because I am surrounded by people who don't think I should even be here. They think I am wasting my time, but in reality, this is a whole new learning experience for me. I'm trying to be positive but keep getting shut down daily. Anyways I feel like   asking this from other people who are already on the path will help keep me motivated to come to work every day this summer. Thank you all in advanced! :D ",1497636345

87,environmental_science,Are soap berries / soap nuts more environmentally friendly than artificial detergents?,"Hi! I've recently come across soap nuts (Sapindus) in Germany. Long story short, they're fruit that naturally contain surfactants and one can use them basically out of the box for washing clothes.

Of course people are going to use for marketing as ""all natural"" soap, regardless of how much nothing ""natural"" means.

Would you consider this product environmentally responsible?

Some factors that I found important, but have zero knowledge on how to evaluate are:

- Since they can be sold in simple plastic bags instead of bulky bottles with thick plastic, the packaging is almost definitely more responsible (looks like https://www.vergleich.org/kaffeevollautomat/wp-content/uploads/thumbnails/sites/1459/planet-pure-waschnuesse-sapindus-mukorossi-53-600x650.jpg)
- How does the cost of cultivating those trees evaluate against ""just mixing ingredients"" to make (artificial) detergent.
- What about transport? I guess one can produce detergent in almost any country but not grow these trees everywhere.
- Another obvious factor could be how much can you reuse the berries (a few times) versus the detergent being away after one wash.
- Other ideas?",1496960196

94,environmental_science,Commitments of Countries in Paris Agreement,"So, I've been hearing a lot about the US dropping the Paris Agreement basically everywhere on the internet. I know I shouldn't bring politics into this but it helps explain a bit. (I'm also on my phone ATM so excuse the bad formatting).


Now, I won't say I'm a Trump Supporter, but I can see some of his and the right's logic on some views. I want to find a reason as to why we would sign out of the Agreement besides a pro business legislation that doesn't care too much about the environment. Many people are citing that the US would be spending the most money if we held onto the Agreement, or that other countries are not footing the bill or paying as much as the United States would have. 


Does anyone have a source of what the larger, more developed countries that are producing the most CO2 are committing (or said they are committing) financially? In terms of assisting the less developed countries move onto cleaner energy, money spent towards cleaner energy within their own country, and even any actual money exchanging or being given to other countries (if that's even happening). 

Thanks
