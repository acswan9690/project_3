12,environmental_science,Local Moranâ€™s I vs Getis-Ord Gi* for Cluster/Hotspot Analysis," Hello! I'm a health researcher, and I was wondering if someone here could perhaps help explain the difference between these two methods and when it might be more appropriate to use one vs the other for cluster/hotspot analysis (I'm studying diabetes and prediabetes prevalence by census tract)? I imagine these spatial/geographic methods are used quite extensively in environmental and geosciences so I thought I'd try asking here! 

I understand that **local Moran's I** allows you to identify both **statistically significant clusters** (areas of high value surrounded by high value neighbors aka hotspots &amp; areas of low value surrounded by low value neighbors aka coldspots) as well as **statistically significant outliers** (areas of high value surrounded by low value neighbors and areas of low value surrounded by high value neighbors) .

By contrast **Getis-Ord Gi\*** only seems to find statistically significant clusters/hotspots/coldspots and not outliers like local Moran's I does.

What are some other differences between these methods that are relevant to deciding which to use to study the prevalence of a disease by census tract? Is it just whether you'd like to find outliers or not? If local Moran's I has no disadvantages since it can find both outliers and clusters why does anyone use Getis-Ord Gi\* if it can only find clusters and not outliers? What is the advantages for it? Is the way neighbors are found different for one vs the other?",1630944030

42,environmental_science,Best practices for falling head hydraulic conductivity tests.,"Hi everyone

I am currently looking at performing a falling head test with some equipment I have set up. I have found a few papers describing the process. 

Briefly: get constant flow through the column, hold the flow, take a head measurement, release the flow and start timing and then once it reaches a desired distance you stop the time and take that as your second head value. Itâ€™s a constant difference in head youâ€™re timing.  

I presented my proposal within my department as part of degree when someone commented on why I wasnâ€™t taking multiple heads as part of best practices. Iâ€™ve looked through quite a few papers and can not find what he was referring to? From what I can tell itâ€™s the same head measurement over a couple of times to get an average K value for a soil. But I cannot for the life of me find what he is referring to. I have tried to ask for some clarification but he has been unable to do so.

Does anyone know what best practices he is referring to? Is it perhaps part of The ASTM?

Thanks in advance",1630410111

This document authored by â€˜World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED)â€™ on the subject of â€˜Sustainabilityâ€™ was published in 1987. This document is also called the â€˜Brundtland Reportâ€™ owing to Norwegian Prime Minister Brundtland who chaired WCED. The drafting of the document was an exercise of 900 days that cataloged, analyzed, synthesized written submissions and testimony of scientists, experts, institutes, NGOs, and the general public. Firstly, the text defined â€˜Sustainable developmentâ€™ as â€˜development which meets the requirements of today without compromising future generationsâ€™ ability to satisfy their own needs.

92,environmental_science,Would nature really be completely wiped out from potential human disasters (nuclear war/global warming) or would it easily continue with time.,"I don't really know much about the environment but this has made me curious. So with the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs and other mass extinctions, nature seemed to have lots of variables to continue survival despite a huge species wipe out. Also if anyone can point out some base life forms most likely to survive the most intense mass extinctions(such as fungi, or cells living deep in the ground i dunno lol). If this is too vague or weird a question no problem i'm just looking for shortcut information to understand this :), peace and love &lt;3.",1629697097
93,environmental_science,Calculating the Cost of Climate Change," 

Hello all,

For a math internal assessment, I'm trying to determine the impact of climate change on tourism in the Caribbean. I've done my research, I know about and (partially) understand the D.I.C.E and R.I.C.E models, but I am struggling to derive the precise formulas and equations which I will need. If any one knows of any helpful studies or ways in which I can go about achieving this idea or attaining these formulas, please let me know! Also, if you have any other suggestions on similar ideas, please don't hesitate to share with me. The project just has to be fairly mathematically in-depth, but only to an advanced highschool/early college level.

I enjoy Calculus, so any ideas falling along that spectrum would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!!",1629655241

98,environmental_science,Undergraduate dissertation advice?,"My dissertation topic regards the design of artificial wetlands for flood attenuation. The main question that I want my research to answer, is the effect of vegetation density (in plants per square metre) on the return period of flood events.

However, my supervisor thinks that this might not be feasible for an undergraduate-level dissertation, due to the lack of relevant data. But they are not too sure. I'm meeting with a catchment manager at my local municipality to discuss this on Monday.

Assuming there is a lack of data, is there a realistic way for me to answer this research question? Can I simulate the data (like simulate how different densities of obstacles affect flow conveyance)?",1629599021
99,environmental_science,Not really sure that this field is for me (advice?),"Hi, everyone. I'm a college junior studying Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences with a concentration in Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology. Like many of my peers, I don't really know what I want to do in the future. I was okay with that uncertainty because I've met a lot of people in this field who eventually found their path. However, the more people I meet, the more uncertain I am that this is right for me. 

Career paths that I've been exposed to in some way and have considered include naturalist at a nature center, government wildlife technician/biologist, or resource technician/forestry. I just feel like so many jobs in this field end up being extremely competitive for little reward/pay. Maybe I just haven't been exposed to enough, but I can't see a path that I want to end up on. I enjoy working outside to some degree, but most of the work I've done ends up feeling like just manual labor, which isn't something that fits me. I'm just feeling very stressed out because I don't know if I can enjoy a job in this field. I'm already in a bit of debt which makes me feel even worse about all of this. If anyone has any advice at all, I'd be happy to listen.",1629592760
